Values used to store the field key and measurement name as special internal tags. reserved tag keys which when present cause the point to be discarded and an error returned Predefined byte representations of special tag keys. set of reserved tag keys which cannot be present when a point is being parsed. ErrPointMustHaveAField is returned when operating on a point that does not have any fields. ErrInvalidNumber is returned when a number is expected but not provided. ErrInvalidPoint is returned when a point cannot be parsed correctly. ErrInvalidKevValuePairs is returned when the number of key, value pairs is odd, indicating a missing value. MaxKeyLength is the largest allowed size of the combined measurement and tag keys. Point defines the values that will be written to the database. Name return the measurement name for the point. SetName updates the measurement name for the point. Tags returns the tag set for the point. ForEachTag iterates over each tag invoking fn.  If fn return false, iteration stops. AddTag adds or replaces a tag value for a point. SetTags replaces the tags for the point. HasTag returns true if the tag exists for the point. Fields returns the fields for the point. Time return the timestamp for the point. SetTime updates the timestamp for the point. UnixNano returns the timestamp of the point as nanoseconds since Unix epoch. HashID returns a non-cryptographic checksum of the point's key. Key returns the key (measurement joined with tags) of the point. String returns a string representation of the point. If there is a timestamp associated with the point then it will be specified with the default precision of nanoseconds. MarshalBinary returns a binary representation of the point. PrecisionString returns a string representation of the point. If there is a timestamp associated with the point then it will be specified in the given unit. RoundedString returns a string representation of the point. If there is a timestamp associated with the point, then it will be rounded to the given duration. Split will attempt to return multiple points with the same timestamp whose string representations are no longer than size. Points with a single field or a point without a timestamp may exceed the requested size. Round will round the timestamp of the point to the given duration. StringSize returns the length of the string that would be returned by String(). AppendString appends the result of String() to the provided buffer and returns the result, potentially reducing string allocations. FieldIterator returns a FieldIterator that can be used to traverse the fields of a point without constructing the in-memory map. FieldType represents the type of a field. Integer indicates the field's type is integer. Float indicates the field's type is float. Boolean indicates the field's type is boolean. String indicates the field's type is string. Empty is used to indicate that there is no field. Unsigned indicates the field's type is an unsigned integer. FieldIterator provides a low-allocation interface to iterate through a point's fields. Next indicates whether there any fields remaining. FieldKey returns the key of the current field. Type returns the FieldType of the current field. StringValue returns the string value of the current field. IntegerValue returns the integer value of the current field. UnsignedValue returns the unsigned value of the current field. BooleanValue returns the boolean value of the current field. FloatValue returns the float value of the current field. Reset resets the iterator to its initial state. Points represents a sortable list of points by timestamp. Len implements sort.Interface. Less implements sort.Interface. Swap implements sort.Interface. point is the default implementation of Point. text encoding of measurement and tags key must always be stored sorted by tags, if the original line was not sorted, we need to resort it text encoding of field data text encoding of timestamp cached version of parsed fields from data cached version of parsed name from key cached version of parsed tags type assertions the number of characters for the largest possible int64 (9223372036854775807) the number of characters for the smallest possible int64 (-9223372036854775808) the number of characters for the largest possible uint64 (18446744073709551615) the number of characters required for the largest float64 before a range check would occur during parsing the number of characters required for smallest float64 before a range check occur ParsePoints returns a slice of Points from a text representation of a point with each point separated by newlines.  If any points fail to parse, a non-nil error will be returned in addition to the points that parsed successfully. ParsePointsString is identical to ParsePoints but accepts a string. ParseKey returns the measurement name and tags from a point. NOTE: to minimize heap allocations, the returned Tags will refer to subslices of buf. This can have the unintended effect preventing buf from being garbage collected. Ignore the error because scanMeasurement returns "missing fields" which we ignore when just parsing a key scanMeasurement returns the location of the comma if there are tags, strip that off ValidPrecision checks if the precision is known. ParsePointsWithPrecision is similar to ParsePoints, but allows the caller to provide a precision for time. NOTE: to minimize heap allocations, the returned Points will refer to subslices of buf. If line is all whitespace, just skip it lines which start with '#' are comments strip the newline if one is present scan the first block which is measurement[,tag1=value1,tag2=value2...] measurement name is required scan the second block is which is field1=value1[,field2=value2,...] at least one field is required scan the last block which is an optional integer timestamp Determine if there are illegal non-whitespace characters after the timestamp block. GetPrecisionMultiplier will return a multiplier for the precision specified. scanKey scans buf starting at i for the measurement and tag portion of the point. It returns the ending position and the byte slice of key within buf.  If there are tags, they will be sorted if they are not already. Determines whether the tags are sort, assume they are indices holds the indexes within buf of the start of each tag.  For example, a buf of 'cpu,host=a,region=b,zone=c' would have indices slice of [4,11,20] which indicates that the first tag starts at buf[4], seconds at buf[11], and last at buf[20] tracks how many commas we've seen so we know how many values are indices. Since indices is an arbitrarily large slice, we need to know how many values in the buffer are in use. First scan the Point's measurement. Optionally scan tags if needed. Iterate over tags keys ensure that we do not encounter any of the reserved tag keys such as _measurement or _field. Now we know where the key region is within buf, and the location of tags, we need to determine if duplicate tags exist and if the tags are sorted. This iterates over the list comparing each tag in the sequence with each other. get the left and right tags If left is greater than right, the tags are not sorted. We do not have to continue because the short path no longer works. If the tags are equal, then there are duplicate tags, and we should abort. If the tags are not sorted, this pass may not find duplicate tags and we need to do a more exhaustive search later. If the tags are not sorted, then sort them.  This sort is inline and uses the tag indices we created earlier.  The actual buffer is not sorted, the indices are using the buffer for value comparison.  After the indices are sorted, the buffer is reconstructed from the sorted indices. Get the measurement name for later Sort the indices Create a new key using the measurement and sorted indices Check again for duplicate tags now that the tags are sorted. The following constants allow us to specify which state to move to next, when scanning sections of a Point. scanMeasurement examines the measurement part of a Point, returning the next state to move to, and the current location in the buffer. Check first byte of measurement, anything except a comma is fine. It can't be a space, since whitespace is stripped prior to this function call. cpu Skip character (it's escaped). Unescaped comma; move onto scanning the tags. Unescaped space; move onto scanning the fields. cpu value=1.0 scanTags examines all the tags in a Point, keeping track of and returning the updated indices slice, number of commas and location in buf where to start examining the Point fields. Grow our indices slice if we have too many tags. tag value always follows a tag key scanTagsKey scans each character in a tag key. First character of the key. cpu,{'', ' ', ',', '='} Examine each character in the tag key until we hit an unescaped equals (the tag value), or we hit an error (i.e., unescaped space or comma). Either we reached the end of the buffer or we hit an unescaped comma or space. cpu,tag{'', ' ', ','} cpu,tag= scanTagsValue scans each character in a tag value. Tag value cannot be empty. cpu,tag={',', ' '} Examine each character in the tag value until we hit an unescaped comma (move onto next tag key), an unescaped space (move onto fields), or we error out. cpu,tag=value An unescaped equals sign is an invalid tag value. cpu,tag={'=', 'fo=o'} cpu,tag=foo, cpu,tag=foo value=1.0 cpu, tag=foo\= value=1.0 This grabs the tag names for i & j, it ignores the values scanFields scans buf, starting at i for the fields section of a point.  It returns the ending position and the byte slice of the fields within buf. tracks how many '=' we've seen tracks how many commas we've seen reached the end of buf? escaped characters? If the value is quoted, scan until we get to the end quote Only quote values in the field value since quotes are not significant in the field key If we see an =, ensure that there is at least on char before and after it check for "... =123" but allow "a\ =123" check for "...a=123,=456" but allow "a=123,a\,=456" check for "... value=" check for "... value=,value2=..." If next byte is not a double-quote, the value must be a boolean reached end of block? check that all field sections had key and values (e.g. prevent "a=1,b" scanTime scans buf, starting at i for the time section of a point. It returns the ending position and the byte slice of the timestamp within buf and and error if the timestamp is not in the correct numeric format. Reached end of block or trailing whitespace? Handle negative timestamps Timestamps should be integers, make sure they are so we don't need to actually  parse the timestamp until needed. scanNumber returns the end position within buf, start at i after scanning over buf for an integer, or float.  It returns an error if a invalid number is scanned. Is negative number? There must be more characters now, as just '-' is illegal. how many decimal points we've see indicates the number is float in scientific notation Can't have more than 1 decimal (e.g. 1.1.1 should fail) `e` is valid for floats but not as the first char + and - are only valid at this point if they follow an e (scientific notation) NaN is an unsupported value It's more common that numbers will be within min/max range for their type but we need to prevent out or range numbers from being parsed successfully.  This uses some simple heuristics to decide if we should parse the number to the actual type.  It does not do it all the time because it incurs extra allocations and we end up converting the type again when writing points to disk. Make sure the last char is an 'i' for integers (e.g. 9i10 is not valid) Parse the int to check bounds the number of digits could be larger than the max range We subtract 1 from the index to remove the `i` from our tests Make sure the last char is a 'u' for unsigned Make sure the first char is not a '-' for unsigned Parse the uint to check bounds the number of digits could be larger than the max range We subtract 1 from the index to remove the `u` from our tests Parse the float to check bounds if it's scientific or the number of digits could be larger than the max range scanBoolean returns the end position within buf, start at i after scanning over buf for boolean. Valid values for a boolean are t, T, true, TRUE, f, F, false, FALSE.  It returns an error if a invalid boolean is scanned. Single char bool (t, T, f, F) is ok length must be 4 for true or TRUE length must be 5 for false or FALSE Otherwise skipWhitespace returns the end position within buf, starting at i after scanning over spaces in tags. scanLine returns the end position in buf and the next line found within buf. tracks how many '=' and commas we've seen this duplicates some of the functionality in scanFields skip past escaped characters If we see a double quote, makes sure it is not escaped scanTo returns the end position in buf and the next consecutive block of bytes, starting from i and ending with stop byte, where stop byte has not been escaped. If there are leading spaces, they are skipped. Reached unescaped stop value? of bytes, starting from i and ending with stop byte.  If there are leading spaces, they are skipped. Only escape char for a field value is a double-quote and backslash Quoted value? (e.g. string) escapeStringFieldReplacer replaces double quotes and backslashes with the same character preceded by a backslash. As of Go 1.7 this benchmarked better in allocations and CPU time compared to iterating through a string byte-by-byte and appending to a new byte slice, calling strings.Replace twice, and better than (*Regex).ReplaceAllString. EscapeStringField returns a copy of in with any double quotes or backslashes with escaped values. unescapeStringField returns a copy of in with any escaped double-quotes or backslashes unescaped. unescape backslashes unescape double-quotes NewPoint returns a new point with the given measurement name, tags, fields and timestamp.  If an unsupported field value (NaN, or +/-Inf) or out of range time is passed, this function returns an error. pointKey checks some basic requirements for valid points, and returns the key, along with an possible error. Ensure the caller validates and handles invalid field values 4 is the length of the tsm1.fieldKeySeparator constant.  It's inlined here to avoid a circular dependency. NewPointFromBytes returns a new Point from a marshalled Point. This does some basic validation to ensure there are fields and they can be unmarshalled as well. Skip since this won't return an error MustNewPoint returns a new point with the given measurement name, tags, fields and timestamp.  If an unsupported field value (NaN) is passed, this function panics. it's an empty key, so there are no tags walkFields walks each field key and value via fn.  If fn returns false, the iteration is stopped.  The values are the raw byte slices and not the converted types. slice off comma parseTags parses buf into the provided destination tags, returning destination Tags, which may have a different length and capacity. Ensure existing behaviour when point has no tags and nil slice passed in. Series keys can contain escaped commas, therefore the number of commas in a series key only gives an estimation of the upper bound on the number of tags. MakeKey creates a key for a set of tags. AppendMakeKey appends the key derived from name and tags to dst and returns the extended buffer. unescape the name and then re-escape it to avoid double escaping. The key should always be stored in escaped form. SetPrecision will round a time to the specified precision. String returns the string representation of the point. AppendString appends the string representation of the point to buf. even "0" has one digit account for negative sign, then negate already accounted for one digit digits and a space UnmarshalBinary decodes a binary representation of the point into a point struct. Read key length. Read key. Read fields length. Read fields. Read timestamp. key string, timestamp string, spaces Tag represents a single key/value tag pair. NewTag returns a new Tag. Size returns the size of the key and value. Clone returns a shallow copy of Tag. Tags associated with a Point created by ParsePointsWithPrecision will hold references to the byte slice that was parsed. Use Clone to create a Tag with new byte slices that do not refer to the argument to ParsePointsWithPrecision. String returns the string reprsentation of the tag. Tags represents a sorted list of tags. NewTags returns a new Tags from a map. NewTagsKeyValues returns a new Tags from a list of key, value pairs, ensuring the returned result is correctly sorted. Duplicate keys are removed, however, it which duplicate that remains is undefined. NewTagsKeyValues will return ErrInvalidKevValuePairs if len(kvs) is not even. If the input is guaranteed to be even, the error can be safely ignored. If a has enough capacity, it will be reused. only copy if j has deviated from i, indicating duplicates NewTagsKeyValuesStrings is equivalent to NewTagsKeyValues, except that it will allocate new byte slices for each key, value pair. Keys returns the list of keys for a tag set. Values returns the list of values for a tag set. String returns the string representation of the tags. Size returns the number of bytes needed to store all tags. Note, this is the number of bytes needed to store all keys and values and does not account for data structures or delimiters for example. Clone returns a copy of the slice where the elements are a result of calling `Clone` on the original elements Use Clone to create Tags with new byte slices that do not refer to the argument to ParsePointsWithPrecision. KeyValues returns the Tags as a list of key, value pairs, maintaining the original order of a. v will be used if it has capacity. sorted returns true if a is sorted and is an optimization to avoid an allocation when calling sort.IsSorted, improving performance as much as 50%. Equal returns true if a equals other. CompareTags returns -1 if a < b, 1 if a > b, and 0 if a == b. Compare each key & value until a mismatch. If all tags are equal up to this point then return shorter tagset. All tags are equal. Get returns the value for a key. OPTIMIZE: Use sort.Search if tagset is large. GetString returns the string value for a string key. Set sets the value for a key. SetString sets the string value for a string key. Delete removes a tag by key. Map returns a map representation of the tags. Merge merges the tags combining the two. If both define a tag with the same key, the merged value overwrites the old value. A new map is returned. HashKey hashes all of a tag's keys. AppendHashKey appends the result of hashing all of a tag's keys and values to dst and returns the extended buffer. Type invariant: Tags are sorted CopyTags returns a shallow copy of tags. DeepCopyTags returns a deep copy of tags. Calculate size of keys/values in bytes. Build single allocation for all key/values. Copy tags to new set. Fields represents a mapping between a Point's field names and their values. to keep the same behavior that currently exists, default to boolean MarshalBinary encodes all the fields to their proper type and returns the binary representation NOTE: uint64 is specifically not supported due to potential overflow when we decode again later to an int64 NOTE2: uint is accepted, and may be 64 bits, and is for some reason accepted... Only sort if we have multiple fields to sort. This length check removes an allocation incurred by the sort. check popular types first TODO: 'uint' should be converted to writing as an unsigned integer, but we cannot since that would break backwards compatibility. skip Can't determine the type, so convert to string ValidToken returns true if the provided token is a valid unicode string, and only contains printable, non-replacement characters. ValidTagTokens returns true if all the provided tag key and values are valid. ValidTagTokens does not validate the special tag keys used to represent the measurement name and field key, but it does validate the associated values. Validate all external tag keys. Validate all tag values (this will also validate the field key, which is a tag value for the special field key tag key). ValidKeyTokens returns true if the measurement name and all tags are valid./Users/austinjaybecker/projects/abeck-go-testing/models/rows.gojson:"columns,omitempty"`json:"columns,omitempty"`json:"values,omitempty"`json:"values,omitempty"` Row represents a single row returned from the execution of a statement. SameSeries returns true if r contains values for the same series as o. tagsHash returns a hash of tag key/value pairs. tagKeys returns a sorted list of tag keys. Rows represents a collection of rows. Rows implements sort.Interface. Sort by name first. Sort by tag set hash. Tags don't have a meaningful sort order so we just compute a hash and sort by that instead. This allows the tests to receive rows in a predictable order every time./Users/austinjaybecker/projects/abeck-go-testing/models/statistic.go Statistic is the representation of a statistic used by the monitoring service. NewStatistic returns an initialized Statistic. StatisticTags is a map that can be merged with others without causing mutations to either map. Merge creates a new map containing the merged contents of tags and t. If both tags and the receiver map contain the same key, the value in tags is used in the resulting map. Merge always returns a usable map. Add everything in tags to the result. Only add values from t that don't appear in tags./Users/austinjaybecker/projects/abeck-go-testing/models/tagkeysset.gokeya TagKeysSet provides set operations for combining Tags. Clear removes all the elements of TagKeysSet and ensures all internal buffers are reset. KeysBytes returns the merged keys in lexicographical order. The slice is valid until the next call to UnionKeys, UnionBytes or Reset. Keys returns a copy of the merged keys in lexicographical order. IsSupersetKeys returns true if the TagKeysSet is a superset of all the keys contained in other. IsSupersetBytes returns true if the TagKeysSet is a superset of all the keys in other. Other must be lexicographically sorted or the results are undefined. UnionKeys updates the set so that it is the union of itself and all the keys contained in other.

MinNanoTime is the minimum time that can be represented. 1677-09-21 00:12:43.145224194 +0000 UTC The two lowest minimum integers are used as sentinel values.  The minimum value needs to be used as a value lower than any other value for comparisons and another separate value is needed to act as a sentinel default value that is unusable by the user, but usable internally. Because these two values need to be used for a special purpose, we do not allow users to write points at these two times. MaxNanoTime is the maximum time that can be represented. 2262-04-11 23:47:16.854775806 +0000 UTC The highest time represented by a nanosecond needs to be used for an exclusive range in the shard group, so the maximum time needs to be one less than the possible maximum number of nanoseconds representable by an int64 so that we don't lose a point at that one time. ErrTimeOutOfRange gets returned when time is out of the representable range using int64 nanoseconds since the epoch. SafeCalcTime safely calculates the time given. Will return error if the time is outside the supported range. CheckTime checks that a time is within the safe range.

This also optimizes the filter by always using a bitset size with a power of 2. Filter represents a bloom filter. NewFilter returns a new instance of Filter using m bits and k hash functions. If m is not a power of two then it is rounded to the next highest power of 2. NewFilterBuffer returns a new instance of a filter using a backing buffer. The buffer length MUST be a power of 2. Len returns the number of bits used in the filter. K returns the number of hash functions used in the filter. Bytes returns the underlying backing slice. Clone returns a copy of f. Insert inserts data to the filter. Contains returns true if the filter possibly contains v. Returns false if the filter definitely does not contain v. Merge performs an in-place union of other into f. Returns an error if m or k of the filters differs. Ensure m & k fields match. Perform union of each byte. location returns the ith hashed location using two hash values. hash returns two 64-bit hashes based on the output of xxhash. We'll put the original byte back. Estimate returns an estimated bit count and hash count given the element count and false positive rate. pow2 returns the number that is the next highest power of 2. Returns v if it is a power of 2./Users/austinjaybecker/projects/abeck-go-testing/pkg/bytesutil/Users/austinjaybecker/projects/abeck-go-testing/pkg/bytesutil/bytesutil.goCloneSliceIsSortedPackSearchBytesSearchBytesFixedSortDedupbyteSlicesjStartbytesutilx is not a multiple of a: %d %d"x is not a multiple of a: %d %d" Sort sorts a slice of byte slices. SortDedup sorts the byte slice a and removes duplicates. The ret SearchBytes performs a binary search for x in the sorted slice a. Define f(i) => bytes.Compare(a[i], x) < 0 Define f(-1) == false and f(n) == true. Invariant: f(i-1) == false, f(j) == true. avoid overflow when computing h i ≤ h < j preserves f(i-1) == false preserves f(j) == true i == j, f(i-1) == false, and f(j) (= f(i)) == true  =>  answer is i. Contains returns true if x is an element of the sorted slice a. SearchBytesFixed searches a for x using a binary search.  The size of a must be a multiple of of x or else the function panics.  There returned value is the index within a where x should exist.  The caller should ensure that x does exist at this index. Union returns the union of a & b in sorted order. Intersect returns the intersection of a & b in sorted order. Clone returns a copy of b. CloneSlice returns a copy of a slice of byte slices. Pack converts a sparse array to a dense one.  It removes sections of a containing runs of val of length width.  The returned value is a subslice of a.

Package deep provides a deep equality check for use in tests. import "github.com/influxdata/influxdb/v2/pkg/deep" Equal is a copy of reflect.DeepEqual except that it treats NaN == NaN as true. Tests for deep equality using reflected types. The map argument tracks comparisons that have already been seen, which allows short circuiting on recursive types. if depth > 10 { panic("deepValueEqual") }	// for debugging Canonicalize order to reduce number of entries in visited. Short circuit if references are identical ... ... or already seen Remember for later. Can't do better than this: Special handling for floats so that NaN == NaN is true. During deepValueEqual, must keep track of checks that are in progress.  The comparison algorithm assumes that all checks in progress are true when it reencounters them.

Pract. Exper. 2010; 40:131–147 It is capable of encoding multiple integers with values betweeen 0 and to 1^60 -1, in a single word. Imported from github.com/jwilder/encoding Simple8b is 64bit word-sized encoder that packs multiple integers into a single word using a 4 bit selector values and up to 60 bits for the remaining values.  Integers are encoded using the following table: ┌──────────────┬─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐ │   Selector   │       0    1   2   3   4   5   6   7  8  9  0 11 12 13 14 15│ ├──────────────┼─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤ │     Bits     │       0    0   1   2   3   4   5   6  7  8 10 12 15 20 30 60│ │      N       │     240  120  60  30  20  15  12  10  8  7  6  5  4  3  2  1│ │   Wasted Bits│      60   60   0   0   0   0  12   0  4  4  0  0  0  0  0  0│ └──────────────┴─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘ For example, when the number of values can be encoded using 4 bits, selected 5 is encoded in the 4 most significant bits followed by 15 values encoded used 4 bits each in the remaining 60 bits. Encoder converts a stream of unsigned 64bit integers to a compressed byte slice. most recently written integers that have not been flushed index in buf of the head of the buf index in buf of the tail of the buf index into bytes of written bytes current bytes written and flushed NewEncoder returns an Encoder able to convert uint64s to compressed byte slices The buf is full but there is space at the front, just shift the values down for now. TODO: use ring buffer encode as many values into one as we can Move the head forward since we encoded those values If we encoded them all, reset the head/tail pointers to the beginning Decoder converts a compressed byte slice to a stream of unsigned 64bit integers. NewDecoder returns a Decoder from a byte slice Next returns true if there are remaining values to be read.  Successive calls to Next advance the current element pointer. Read returns the current value.  Successive calls to Read return the same value. Count returns the number of integers encoded in the byte slice Count returns the number of integers encoded within an uint64 If the max value that could be encoded by the uint64 is less than the min skip the whole thing. Encode packs as many values into a single uint64.  It returns the packed uint64, how many values from src were packed, or an error if the values exceed the maximum value range. { number of values, max bits per value } Encode returns a packed slice of the values from src.  If a value is over 1 << 60, an error is returned.  The input src is modified to avoid extra allocations.  If you need to re-use, use a copy. Re-use the input slice and write encoded values back in place try to pack run of 240 or 120 1s Invariant: len(a) is fixed to 120 or 240 values search for the longest sequence of 1s in a Postcondition: k equals the index of the last 1 or -1 240 1s at least 120 1s Decode writes the uncompressed values from src to dst.

The underlying limiter can be shared to limit faults across the entire process. WaitPointer checks if ptr would cause a page fault and, if so, rate limits its access. Once a page access is limited, it's updated to be considered memory resident. Check if the page is in-memory under lock. However, we want to exclude the wait from the limiter lock. Update incore mapping if data is too stale. WaitRange checks all pages in b for page faults and, if so, rate limits their access. Empty byte slices will never access memory so skip them. Check every page for being in-memory under lock. Iterate over every page within the range. Check if page access requires page fault. If not, exit immediately. If so, mark the page as memory resident afterward. Otherwise mark page as resident in memory and rate limit. IsInCore returns true if the address is resident in memory or if the address is outside the range of the data the limiter is tracking. Update updates the vector of in-core pages.

Limited to 2^64. Reset clears the values in the map without deallocating the space. Get returns the value for a key from the Hashmap, or nil if no key exists. Grow the map if we've run out of slots. If the key was overwritten then decrement the size. Put stores the value at key in the Hashmap, overwriting an existing value if one exists. If the maximum load of the Hashmap is reached, the Hashmap will first resize itself. PutQuiet is equivalent to Put, but no instrumentation code is executed. It can be faster when many keys are being inserted into the Hashmap. Continue searching until we find an empty slot or lower probe distance. Empty slot found or matching key, insert and exit.

It walks over the directory and subdirs, possibly writing each file to a tar writer stream.  By default StreamFile is used, which will result in all files being written.  A custom writeFunc can be passed so that each file may be written, modified+written, or skipped depending on the custom logic. Skip adding an entry for the root dir Figure out the the full relative path including any sub-dirs Generates a filtering function for Stream that checks an incoming file, and only writes the file to the stream if its mod time is later than since.  Example: to tar only files newer than a certain datetime, use tar.Stream(w, dir, relativePath, SinceFilterTarFile(datetime)) stream a single file to tw, extending the header name using the shardRelativePath/ Stream a single file to tw, using tarHeaderFileName instead of the actual filename e.g., when we want to write a *.tmp file using the original file's non-tmp name. Restore reads a tar archive from r and extracts all of its files into dir, using only the base name of each file. extractFile copies the next file from tr into dir, using the file's base name. Read next archive file. The hdr.Name is the relative path of the file from the root data dir. e.g (db/rp/1/xxxxx.tsm or db/rp/1/index/xxxxxx.tsi) If this is a directory entry (usually just `index` for tsi), create it an move on. Make sure the dir we need to write into exists.  It should, but just double check in case we get a slightly invalid tarball. Create new file on disk. Copy from archive to the file.

Package tracing provides a way for capturing hierarchical traces.

To start a new trace with a root span named select

    trace, span := tracing.NewTrace("select")

It is recommended that a span be forwarded to callees using the
context package. Firstly, create a new context with the span associated
as follows

	ctx = tracing.NewContextWithSpan(ctx, span)

followed by calling the API with the new context

	SomeAPI(ctx, ...)

Once the trace is complete, it may be converted to a graph with the Tree method.

	tree := t.Tree()

The tree is intended to be used with the Walk function in order to generate
different presentations. The default Tree#String method returns a tree.

A lot of issues to account for when exposing this to the outside world. Not something I'm keen to accommodate at this time. OK validates a resource clone is viable. sorting this in priority order guarantees that the dependencies/associations for a resource are handled prior to the resource being processed. 	i.e. if a bucket depends on a label, then labels need to be run first		to guarantee they are available before a bucket is exported. we only need an id when we have resources that are not unique by name via the metastore. resoureces that are unique by name will be provided a default stamp making looksup unique since each resource will be unique by name. overwrite the default metadata.name field with export generated one here check here verifies the label maps to an id of a valid label name BucketToObject converts a influxdb.Bucket into an Object.

Package pkger implements a means to create and consume reusable
templates for what will eventually come to support all influxdb
resources.

The parser supports JSON, Jsonnet, and YAML encodings as well as a number
of different ways to read the file/reader/string as it may.

As an example, you can use the following to parse and validate a YAML
file and see a summary of its contents:

	newTemplate, err := Parse(EncodingYAML, FromFile(PATH_TO_FILE))
	if err != nil {
		panic(err) // handle error as you see fit
	}
	sum := newTemplate.Summary()
	fmt.Println(sum) // do something with the summary

The parser will validate all contents of the template and provide any
and all fields/entries that failed validation.

If you wish to use the Template type in your transport layer and let the
the transport layer manage the decoding, then you can run the following
to validate the template after the raw decoding is done:

	if err := template.Validate(); err != nil {
		panic(err) // handle error as you see fit
	}

If a validation error is encountered during the validation or parsing then
the error returned will be of type *parseErr. The parseErr provides a rich
set of validations failures. There can be numerous failures in a template
and we did our best to inform the caller about them all in a single run.

If you want to see the effects of a template before applying it to the
organization's influxdb platform, you have the flexibility to dry run the
template and see the outcome of what would happen after it were to be applied.
You may use the following to dry run a template within your organization:

	svc := NewService(serviceOpts...)
	summary, diff, err := svc.DryRun(ctx, orgID, userID, ApplyWithTemplate(template))
	if err != nil {
		panic(err) // handle error as you see fit
	}
	// explore the summary and diff

The diff provided here is a diff of the existing state of the platform for
your organization and the concluding the state after the application of a
template. All buckets, labels, and variables, when given a name that already
exists, will not create a new resource, but rather, will edit the existing
resource. If this is not a desired result, then rename your bucket to something
else to avoid the imposed changes applying this template would incur. The summary
provided is a summary of the template itself. If a resource exists all IDs will
be populated for them, if they do not, then they will be zero values. Any zero
value ID is safe to assume is not populated. All influxdb.ID's must be non zero
to be in existence.

If you would like to apply a template you may use the service to do so. The
following will apply the template in full to the provided organization.

	svc := NewService(serviceOpts...)
	summary, err := svc.Apply(ctx, orgID, userID, ApplyWithTemplate(template))
	if err != nil {
		panic(err) // handle error as you see fit
	}
	// explore the summary

The summary will be populated with valid IDs that were created during the
application of the template. If an error is encountered during the application
of a template, then all changes that had occurred will be rolled back. However, as
a warning for buckets, changes may have incurred destructive changes. The changes
are not applied inside a large transaction, for numerous reasons, but it is
something to be considered. If you have dry run the template before it is to be
applied, then the changes should have been made known to you. If not, then there is
potential loss of data if the changes to a bucket resulted in the retention period
being shortened in the template.

If you would like to export existing resources into the form of a template, then you
have the ability to do so using the following:

	resourcesToClone := []ResourceToClone{
		{
			Kind: KindBucket,
			ID:   Existing_BUCKET_ID,
			Name: "new bucket name"
		},
		{
			Kind: KindDashboard,
			ID:   Existing_Dashboard_ID,
		},
		{
			Kind: KindLabel,
			ID:   Existing_Label_ID,
		},
		{
			Kind: KindVarible,
			ID:   Existing_Var_ID,
		},
	}

	svc := NewService(serviceOpts...)
	newTemplate, err := svc.Export(ctx, ExportWithExistingResources(resourcesToClone...))
	if err != nil {
		panic(err) // handle error as you see fit
	}
	// explore newly created and validated template

Things to note about the behavior of exporting existing resources. All label
associations with existing resources will be included in the new template.
However, the variables that are used within a dashboard query will not be added
automatically to the template. Variables will need to be passed in alongside
the dashboard to be added to the template.

Encoder is an encodes a type. Encoding describes the encoding for the raw package data. The encoding determines how the raw data is parsed. encoding types EncodingSource draws the encoding type by inferring it from the source. String provides the string representation of the encoding. ErrInvalidEncoding indicates the encoding is invalid type for the parser. Parse parses a pkg defined by the encoding and readerFns. As of writing this we can parse both a YAML, JSON, and Jsonnet formats of the Template model. FromFile reads a file from disk and provides a reader from it. not using os.Open to avoid having to deal with closing the file in here FromReader simply passes the reader along. Useful when consuming this from an HTTP request body. There are a number of other useful places for this functional input. FromString parses a pkg from a raw string value. This is very useful in tests. FromHTTPRequest parses a pkg from the request body of a HTTP request. This is very useful when using packages that are hosted.. highly unlikely to fall in here with supported content type detection as is forced to use this for loop b/c the yaml dependency does not decode multi documents. Object describes the metadata and raw spec for an entity of a package kind. Name returns the name of the kind. ObjectAssociation is an association for an object. The supported types at this time are KindLabel. AddAssociations adds an association to the object. SetMetadataName sets the metadata.name field. Template is the model for a package. The resources are more generic that one might expect at first glance. This was done on purpose. The way json/yaml/toml or w/e scripting you want to use, can have very different ways of parsing. The different parsers are limited for the parsers that do not come from the std lib (looking at you yaml/v2). This allows us to parse it and leave the matching to another power, the graphing of the package is handled within itself. indicates the pkg has been parsed and all resources graphed accordingly Encode is a helper for encoding the pkg correctly. note: we prevent the internal field from being changed by enabling access 		 to the sources via the exported method here. Summary returns a package Summary that describes all the resources and associations the pkg contains. It is very useful for informing users of the changes that will take place when this pkg would be applied. ensure zero values for arrays aren't returned, but instead we always returning an initialized slice. Contains identifies if a pkg contains a given object identified by its kind and metadata.Name (MetaName) field. Combine combines pkgs together. Is useful when you want to take multiple disparate pkgs and compile them into one to take advantage of the parser and service guarantees. ValidateOptFn provides a means to disable desired validation checks. ValidWithoutResources ignores the validation check for minimum number of resources. This is useful for the service Create to ignore this and allow the creation of a pkg without resources. ValidSkipParseError ignores the validation check from the  of resources. This is useful for the service Create to ignore this and allow the creation of a pkg without resources. Validate will graph all resources and validate every thing is in a useful form. labelMappings returns the mappings that will be created for valid pairs of labels and resources of which all have IDs. If a resource does not exist yet, a label mapping will not be returned for it. sort by res type ASC, then res name ASC, then label name ASC labels are first, this is to validate associations with other resources todo: what is the business goal wrt having unique names? (currently duplicates are allowed) override defaults here maybe? a signed duration is represented by a UnaryExpression. it is the only unary expression allowed. dns1123LabelMaxLength is a label's max length in DNS (RFC 1123) isDNS1123Label tests for a string that conforms to the definition of a label in DNS (RFC 1123). regexError returns a string explanation of a regex validation failure. Resource is a pkger Resource kind. It can be one of any of available kinds that are supported. Name returns the name of the resource. ParseError is the error from parsing the given package. The ParseError behavior provides a list of resources that failed and all validations that failed for that resource. A resource can multiple errors, and a parseErr can have multiple resources which themselves can have multiple validation failures. NewParseError creates a new parse error from existing validation errors. resourceErr describes the error for a particular resource. In which it may have numerous validation and association errors. used to provide a means to == or != in the map lookup to remove duplicate errors ValidationErr represents an error during the parsing of a package. IsParseErr inspects a given error to determine if it is a parseErr. If a parseErr it is, it will return it along with the confirmation boolean. If the error is not a parseErr it will return nil values for the parseErr, making it unsafe to use./Users/austinjaybecker/projects/abeck-go-testing/pkger/parser_models.goiThreshspacedKindqueryRefsqIdxvalidatorFnvalidatorFnsptrToFloat64clrtMapcErraxexpectedAxesmAxesiLabelssRuleErrstagErrssjtjtranslatorqueryBodywriteLinelastImportIdxquerySansImportstaskOptsminLengthmetadata.name"metadata.name"spec.name"spec.name""apiVersion""language""metadata""operator""prefix""suffix""spec""retentionRules"json:"type" yaml:"type"`json:"type" yaml:"type"`json:"everySeconds" yaml:"everySeconds"`json:"everySeconds" yaml:"everySeconds"`seconds must be a minimum of "seconds must be a minimum of "type must be "expire"`type must be "expire"`"everySeconds""allValues""reportZero""staleTime""statusMessageTemplate""thresholds""timeSince"duration value must be provided that is >= 5s (seconds)"duration value must be provided that is >= 5s (seconds)"must provide a non zero value"must provide a non zero value"must provide a template; ex.

Will be super challenging for anyone outside org to figure out how to do this within an hour of looking at the API :sadpanda:. Would be ideal to let the API translate the arguments into this required form instead of forcing that complexity on the caller. this zero value check is for situations where we want to marshal/unmarshal a variable and not have the invalid args blow up during unmarshalling.

Stack is an identifier for stateful application of a package(s). This stack will map created resources from the template(s) to existing resources on the platform. This stack is updated only after side effects of applying a template. If the template is applied, and no changes are had, then the stack is not updated. StackResource is a record for an individual resource side effect generated from applying a template. StackResourceAssociation associates a stack resource with another stack resource. StackUpdate provides a means to update an existing stack. SVC is the packages service interface. SVCMiddleware is a service middleware func. ServiceSetterFn is a means of setting dependencies on the Service type. WithLogger sets the logger for the service. WithIDGenerator sets the id generator for the service. WithTimeGenerator sets the time generator for the service. WithStore sets the store for the service. WithBucketSVC sets the bucket service. WithCheckSVC sets the check service. WithDashboardSVC sets the dashboard service. WithLabelSVC sets the label service. WithNotificationEndpointSVC sets the endpoint notification service. WithNotificationRuleSVC sets the endpoint rule service. WithOrganizationService sets the organization service for the service. WithSecretSVC sets the secret service. WithTaskSVC sets the task service. WithTelegrafSVC sets the telegraf service. WithVariableSVC sets the variable service. Store is the storage behavior the Service depends on. Service provides the template business logic including all the dependencies to make this resource sausage. internal dependencies external service dependencies NewService is a constructor for a template Service. InitStack will create a new stack for the given user and its given org. The stack can be created with urls that point to the location of packages that are included as part of the stack when it is applied. UninstallStack will remove all resources associated with the stack. DeleteStack removes a stack and all the resources that have are associated with the stack. providing empty template will remove all applied resources ListFilter are filter options for filtering stacks from being returned. ListStacks returns a list of stacks. ReadStack returns a stack that matches the given id. UpdateStack updates the stack by the given parameters. ExportOptFn is a functional input for setting the template fields. ExportOpt are the options for creating a new package. ExportByOrgIDOpt identifies an org to export resources for and provides multiple filtering options. ExportWithExistingResources allows the create method to clone existing resources. ExportWithAllOrgResources allows the create method to clone all existing resources for the given organization. ExportWithStackID provides an export for the given stack ID. Export will produce a templates from the parameters provided. ImpactSummary represents the impact the application of a template will have on the system. pull name `name` from community url https://raw.githubusercontent.com/influxdata/community-templates/master/name/name_template.yml so here's the deal, when we have issues with the parsing validation, we continue to do the diff anyhow. any resource that does not have a name will be skipped, and won't bleed into the dry run here. We can now return a error (parseErr) and valid diff/summary. grab em all marked true since it exists in the platform if label is found in state then we track the mapping and mark it existing otherwise we continue on now we add labels that do not exist ApplyOpt is an option for applying a package. ActionSkipResource provides an action from the consumer to use the template with modifications to the resource kind and template name that will be applied. ActionSkipKind provides an action from the consumer to use the template with modifications to the resource kinds will be applied. ApplyOptFn updates the ApplyOpt per the functional option. ApplyWithEnvRefs provides env refs to saturate the missing reference fields in the template. ApplyWithTemplate provides a template to the application/dry run. ApplyWithResourceSkip provides an action skip a resource in the application of a template. ApplyWithKindSkip provides an action skip a kidn in the application of a template. ApplyWithSecrets provides secrets to the platform that the template will need. ApplyWithStackID associates the application of a template with a stack. from before the template were applied. if stackID is not provided, a stack will be provided for the application. each grouping here runs for its entirety, then returns an error that is indicative of running all appliers provided. For instance, the labels may have 1 variable fail and one of the buckets fails. The errors aggregate so the caller will be informed of both the failed label variable the failed bucket. the groupings here allow for steps to occur before exiting. The first step is adding the dependencies, resources that are associated by other resources. Then the primary resources. Here we get all the errors associated with them. If those are all good, then we run the secondary(dependent) resources which rely on the primary resources having been created. adds secrets that are referenced it the template, this allows user to provide data that does not rest in the template. deps for primary resources primary resources, can have relationships to labels this has to be run after the above primary resources, because it relies on notification endpoints already being applied. secondary resources this last grouping relies on the above 2 steps having completely successfully TODO: fixup error stub out userID since we're always using hte http client which will fill it in for us with the token feels a bit broken that is required. TODO: look into this userID requirement here we have to couple the endpoints to rules b/c of the dependency here when rolling back a deleted endpoint and rule. This forces the endpoints to be rolled back first so the reference for the rule has settled. The dependency has to be available before rolling back notification rules. setting status to unknown b/c these resources for two reasons:	1. we have no ability to find status via the Service, only to set it...	2. we have no way of inspecting an existing rule and pulling status from it	3. since this is a fallback condition, we set things to inactive as a user		is likely to follow up this failure by fixing their template up then reapplying when an existing variable (referenced in stack) has been deleted by a user then the resource is created anew to get it back to the expected state. this block here does 2 things, it does not write a mapping when one exists. it also avoids having to worry about deleting an existing mapping since it will not be passed to the delete function below b/c it is never added to the list of mappings that is referenced in the delete call. these are the case where a deletion happens and is rolled back creating a new resource. when resource is not to be removed this is a nothing burger, as it should be rolled back to previous state.

StoreKV is a store implementation that uses a kv store backing. NewStoreKV creates a new StoreKV entity. This does not initialize the store. You will want to init it if you want to have this init donezo at startup. If not it'll lazy load the buckets as they are used. CreateStack will create a new stack. If collisions are found will fail. existing data before stacks are event sourced have this shape. since the stackIDs are a filter, if it is not found, we just continue on.

The Controller manages the resources available to each query by managing the memory allocation and concurrency usage of each query. The Controller will compile a program by using the passed in language and it will start the program using the ResourceManager. It will guarantee that each program that is started has at least one goroutine that it can use with the dispatcher and it will ensure a minimum amount of memory is available before the program runs. Other goroutines and memory usage is at the will of the specific resource strategy that the Controller is using. The Controller also provides visibility into the lifetime of the query and its current resource usage. orgLabel is the metric label to use in the controller Controller provides a central location to manage all incoming queries. The controller is responsible for compiling, queueing, and executing queries. ConcurrencyQuota is the number of queries that are allowed to execute concurrently. InitialMemoryBytesQuotaPerQuery is the initial number of bytes allocated for a query when it is started. If this is unset, then the MemoryBytesQuotaPerQuery will be used. MemoryBytesQuotaPerQuery is the maximum number of bytes (in table memory) a query is allowed to use at any given time. A query may not be able to use its entire quota of memory if requesting more memory would conflict with the maximum amount of memory that the controller can request. MaxMemoryBytes is the maximum amount of memory the controller is allowed to allocated to queries. If this is unset, then this number is ConcurrencyQuota * MemoryBytesQuotaPerQuery. This number must be greater than or equal to the ConcurrencyQuota * InitialMemoryBytesQuotaPerQuery. This number may be less than the ConcurrencyQuota * MemoryBytesQuotaPerQuery. QueueSize is the number of queries that are allowed to be awaiting execution before new queries are rejected. MetricLabelKeys is a list of labels to add to the metrics produced by the controller. The value for a given key will be read off the context. The context value must be a string or an implementation of the Stringer interface. complete will fill in the defaults, validate the configuration, and return the new Config. Validate will validate that the controller configuration is valid. Query satisfies the AsyncQueryService while ensuring the request is propagated on the context. Set the request on the context so platform specific Flux operations can retrieve it later. Set the org label value for controller metricslint:ignore SA1029 this is a temporary ignore until we have time to create an appropriate type The controller injects the dependencies for each incoming request. Add per-transformation spans if the feature flag is set. query submits a query for execution returning immediately. Done must be called on any returned Query objects. Lock the queries mutex for the rest of this method. Query controller was shutdown between when we started creating the query and ending it. executeQuery will execute a compiled program and wait for its completion. This may happen if the query was cancelled (either because the client cancelled it, or because the controller is shutting down) In the case of cancellation, SetErr() should reset the error to an appropriate message. Record unused memory before start. waitForQuery will wait until the query is done. Queries reports the active queries. Shutdown will signal to the Controller that it should not accept any new queries and that it should finish executing any existing queries. This will return once the Controller's run loop has been exited and all queries have been finished or until the Context has been canceled. Mark that the controller is shutdown so it does not accept new queries. Cancel all of the currently active queries. Wait for query processing goroutines to finish. Wait for all of the queries to be cleaned up or until the context is done. Query represents a single request. query state. The stateMu protects access for the group below. ID reports an ephemeral unique ID for the query. Cancel will stop the query execution. Call the cancel function to signal that execution should be interrupted. Results returns a channel that will deliver the query results. It's possible that the channel is closed before any results arrive. In particular, if a query's context or the query itself is canceled, the query may close the results channel before any results are computed. The query may also have an error during execution so the Err() function should be used to check if an error happened. Done signals to the Controller that this query is no longer being used and resources related to the query may be freed. This must only be invoked once. All done calls should block until the first done call succeeds. Lock the state mutex and transition to the finished state. Then force the query to cancel to tell it to stop executing. We transition to the new state first so that we do not enter the canceled state at any point (as we have not been canceled). Ensure that all of the results have been drained. It is ok to read this as the user has already indicated they don't care about the results. When this is closed, it tells us an error has been set or the results have finished being pumped. Do nothing with the results. No other goroutines should be modifying state at this point so we can do things that would be unsafe in another context. Mark the program as being done and copy out the error if it exists. TODO(jsternberg): The underlying program never returns this so maybe their interface should change? Merge the metadata from the program into the controller stats. Retrieve the runtime errors that have been accumulated. Mark the query as finished so it is removed from the query map. Release the additional memory associated with this query. Record unused memory after finish. Count query request. Statistics reports the statistics for the query. This method must be called after Done. It will block until the query has been finalized unless a context is given. State reports the current state of the query. If the query is a non-finished state, check the context to see if we have been interrupted. The query has been canceled so report to the outside world that we have been canceled. Do NOT attempt to change the internal state variable here. It is a minefield. Leave the normal query execution to figure that out. The context has not been canceled. transitionTo will transition from one state to another. If a list of current states is given, then the query must be in one of those states for the transition to succeed. This method must be called with a lock and it must be called from within the run loop. If we are transitioning to a non-finished state, the query may have been canceled. If the query was canceled, then we need to transition to the canceled state Transition to the canceled state and report that we failed to transition to the desired state. Find the current state in the list of current states. We are transitioning to a new state. Close the current span (if it exists). Invoke the cancel function to ensure that we have signaled that the query should be done. The user is supposed to read the entirety of the tables returned before we end up in a finished state, but user error may have caused this not to happen so there's no harm to canceling multiple times. If we are transitioning to a finished state from a non-finished state, finish the parent span. Transition to the new state. Start a new span and set a new context. This state is not tracked so do not create a new span or context for it. Use the parent context if one is needed. Err reports any error the query may have encountered. setErr marks this query with an error. If the query was canceled, then the error is ignored. This will mark the query as ready so setResults must not be called if this method is invoked. We may have this get called when the query is canceled. If that is the case, transition to the canceled state instead and record the error from that since the error we received is probably wrong. Close the ready channel to report that no results will be sent. pump will read from the executing query results and pump the results to our destination. When there are no more results, then this will close our own results channel. When our context is canceled, we need to propagate that cancel signal down to the executing program just in case it is waiting for a cancel signal and is ignoring the passed in context. We want this signal to only be sent once and we want to continue draining the results until the underlying program has actually been finished so we copy this to a new channel and set it to nil when it has been closed. It is possible for the underlying query to misbehave. We have to continue pumping results even if this is the case, but if the query has been canceled or finished with done, nobody is going to read these values so we need to avoid blocking. Signal to the underlying executor that the query has been canceled. Usually, the signal on the context is likely enough, but this explicitly signals just in case. Set the done channel to nil so we don't do this again and we continue to drain the results. If we get here, then any running queries should have been cancelled in controller.Shutdown(). tryCompile attempts to transition the query into the Compiling state. tryQueue attempts to transition the query into the Queueing state. tryExec attempts to transition the query into the Executing state. State is the query state. Created indicates the query has been created. Compiling indicates that the query is in the process of executing the compiler associated with the query. Queueing indicates the query is waiting inside of the scheduler to be executed. Executing indicates that the query is currently executing. Errored indicates that there was an error when attempting to execute a query within any state inside of the controller. Finished indicates that the query has been marked as Done and it is awaiting removal from the Controller or has already been removed. Canceled indicates that the query was signaled to be canceled. A canceled query must still be released with Done. handleFluxError will take a flux.Error and convert it into an influxdb.Error. It will match certain codes to the equivalent in influxdb. If the error is any other type of error, it will return the error untouched. TODO(jsternberg): This likely becomes a public function, but this is just an initial implementation so playing it safe by making it package local for now. If we are inheriting the error code, influxdb doesn't have an equivalent of this so we need to retrieve the error code from the wrapped error which has already been translated to an influxdb error (if possible). These don't really map correctly, but we want them to show up as 4XX so until influxdb error codes are updated for more types of failures, mapping these to invalid. Everything else is treated as an internal error which is set above.sideEffectsSideEffectsImportPackageObjectColListTableBuildercolumnBuilderSetNilAppendBoolsGrowBoolsAppendIntsGrowIntsAppendUIntsGrowUIntsAppendFloatsGrowFloatsAppendStringsGrowStringsAppendTimesGrowTimescolMetanrowsNRowsNColsAddColLevelColumnsSetUIntAppendUIntAppendValueAppendNilcheckColGetRowSliceColumnsClearDataFilesLength/Users/austinjaybecker/projects/abeck-go-testing/query/control/memory.goamountCompareAndSwapInt64query hit hard limit"query hit hard limit"not enough capacity"not enough capacity" initialBytesQuotaPerQuery is the initial amount of memory allocated for each query. It does not count against the memory pool. memoryBytesQuotaPerQuery is the maximum amount of memory that may be allocated to each query. unusedMemoryBytes is the amount of memory that may be used when a query requests more memory. This value is only used when unlimited is set to false. unlimited indicates that the memory manager should indicate there is an unlimited amount of free memory available. createAllocator will construct an allocator and memory manager for the given query. Use an anonymous function to ensure the value is copied. queryMemoryManager is a memory manager for a specific query. RequestMemory will determine if the query can be given more memory when it is requested. Note: This function accesses the memoryManager whose attributes may be modified concurrently. Atomic operations are used to keep it lockless. The data associated with this specific query are only invoked from within a lock so they are safe to modify. Second Note: The errors here are discarded anyway so don't worry too much about the specific message or structure. It can be determined statically if we are going to violate the memoryBytesQuotaPerQuery. We do not have the capacity for this query to be given more memory. The memory allocator will only request the bare amount of memory it needs, but it will probably ask for more memory so, if possible, give it more so it isn't repeatedly calling this method. Reserve this memory for our own use. The unused value has changed so someone may have taken the memory that we wanted. Retry. Successfully reserved the memory so update our own internal counter for the limit. giveMemory will determine an appropriate amount of memory to give a query based on what it wants and how much it has allocated in the past. It will always return a number greater than or equal to want. If we can safely double the limit, then just do that. Doubling the limit sends us over the quota. Determine what would be our maximum amount. If we can't double because there isn't enough space in unused, maybe we can just use everything. Otherwise we have already determined we can give the wanted number of bytes so just give that. Not implemented. There is no problem with invoking this method, but the controller won't recognize that the memory has been declared as returned. Release will release all of the allocated memory to the memory manager./Users/austinjaybecker/projects/abeck-go-testing/query/control/metrics.go"compile_error""queue_error""control"functions_total"functions_total"Count of functions in queries"Count of functions in queries"function"function"all_active"all_active"Number of queries in all states"Number of queries in all states"compiling_active"compiling_active"Number of queries actively compiling"Number of queries actively compiling"compiler_type"compiler_type"queueing_active"queueing_active"Number of queries actively queueing"Number of queries actively queueing"executing_active"executing_active"Number of queries actively executing"Number of queries actively executing"memory_unused_bytes"memory_unused_bytes"The free memory as seen by the internal memory manager"The free memory as seen by the internal memory manager"all_duration_seconds"all_duration_seconds"Histogram of total times spent in all query states"Histogram of total times spent in all query states"compiling_duration_seconds"compiling_duration_seconds"Histogram of times spent compiling queries"Histogram of times spent compiling queries"queueing_duration_seconds"queueing_duration_seconds"Histogram of times spent queueing queries"Histogram of times spent queueing queries"/Users/austinjaybecker/projects/abeck-go-testing/query/dependency.goallBucketsmissing request on context"missing request on context" FromBucketService wraps an influxdb.BucketService in the BucketLookup interface.

If we have more than 1, then we have another error message. Otherwise, we create a single group. Always a selector if we are here. We do not have any auxiliary fields so each of the function calls goes into its own group. If there is exactly one group and that contains a selector or a transformation function, then mark it does not need normalization. Create all of the cursors for every variable reference. TODO(jsternberg): Determine which of these cursors are from fields and which are tags. TODO(jsternberg): This should be validated and figured out somewhere else. TODO(jsternberg): Establish which variables in the condition are tags and which are fields. We need to create the references to fields here so they can be joined. Walk through the condition for every variable reference. There will be no function calls here. If the variable reference is in any of the cursors, it is definitely a field and we do not have to inspect it further. This may be a field or a tag. If it is a field, we need to create the cursor and add it to the listing of cursors so it can be joined before we evaluate the condition. Add this variable name to the listing of tags. Join the cursors using an inner join. TODO(jsternberg): We need to differentiate between various join types and this needs to be except: ["_field"] rather than joining on the _measurement. This also needs to specify what the time column should be. Evaluate the conditional and insert a filter if a condition exists. // Generate a filter expression by evaluating the condition and wrapping it in a filter op. Group together the results. If a function call is present, evaluate the function call. If there was a window operation, we now need to undo that and sort by the start column so they stay in the same table and are joined in the correct order.

NewResponseIterator constructs a flux.ResultIterator from a Response. More returns true if there are results left to iterate through. It is used to implement flux.ResultIterator. Next retrieves the next flux.Result. Release is a noop. Err returns an error if the response contained an error. seriesIterator is a simple wrapper for Result that implements flux.Result and flux.TableIterator. Name returns the results statement id. It is used to implement flux.Result. Tables returns the original as a flux.TableIterator. Do iterates through the series of a Result. It is used to implement flux.TableIterator. queryTable implements flux.Table and flux.ColReader. Data in a column is laid out in the following way:   [ r.row.Columns... , r.tagKeys()... , r.row.Name ] Key constructs the flux.GroupKey for a Row from the rows tags and measurement. It is used to implement flux.Table and flux.ColReader. plus one is for measurement tags returns the tag keys for a Row. Cols returns the columns for a row where the data is laid out in the following way: rename the time column Do applies f to itself. This is because Row is a flux.ColReader. It is used to implement flux.Table. Empty returns true if a Row has no values. Len returns the length or r.row.Values It is used to implement flux.ColReader. Bools returns the values in column index j as bools. It will panic if the column is not a []bool. Ints returns the values in column index j as ints. It will panic if the column is not a []int64. UInts returns the values in column index j as ints. It will panic if the column is not a []uint64. Floats returns the values in column index j as floats.

Encode writes a collection of results to the influxdb 1.X http response format. Expectations/Assumptions:  1.  Each result will be published as a 'statement' in the top-level list of results. The result name      will be interpreted as an integer and used as the statement id.  2.  If the _measurement name is present in the group key, it will be used as the result name instead      of as a normal tag.  3.  All columns in the group key must be strings and they will be used as tags. There is no current way      to have a tag and field be the same name in the results.      TODO(jsternberg): For full compatibility, the above must be possible.  4.  All other columns are fields and will be output in the order they are found.      TODO(jsternberg): This function currently requires the first column to be a time field, but this isn't      a strict requirement and will be lifted when we begin to work on transpiling meta queries. Skip any columns that aren't strings. They are extra ones that flux includes by default like the start and end times that we do not care about. If the field key was not removed by a previous operation, we explicitly ignore it here when encoding the result back. TODO: resultColMap should be constructed from query metadata once it is provided. for now we know that an influxql query ALWAYS has time first, so we put this placeholder here to catch this most obvious requirement.  Column orderings should be explicitly determined from the ordering given in the original flux. Preallocate the number of rows for the response to make this section of code easier to read.

Transpiler converts InfluxQL queries into a query spec. Parse the text of the query. Stamp the current time using the now time. While the ShowTagValuesStatement contains a sources section and those sources are measurements, they do not actually contain the database and we do not factor in retention policies. So we are always going to use the default retention policy when evaluating which bucket we are querying and we do not have to consult the sources in the statement. TODO(jsternberg): Read the range from the condition expression. 1.x doesn't actually do this so it isn't urgent to implement this functionality so we can use the default range. If we have a list of sources, look through it and add each of the measurement names. TODO(jsternberg): Add the condition filter for the where clause. Create the key values op spec from the Group by the measurement and key, find distinct values, then group by the measurement to join all of the different keys together. Finish by renaming the columns. This is static. Clone the select statement and omit the time from the list of column names. Join the cursors together on the measurement name. TODO(jsternberg): This needs to join on all remaining group keys. Map each of the fields into another cursor. This evaluates any lingering expressions. TODO(jsternberg): Actually evaluate the type against the schema.

If this is set then logging happens only if this key is present in the metadata. LoggingProxyQueryServiceOption provides a way to modify the behavior of LoggingProxyQueryService. ConditionalLogging returns a LoggingProxyQueryServiceOption that only logs if the passed in function returns true. Thus logging can be controlled by a request-scoped attribute, e.g., a feature flag. Query executes and logs the query. Logging is conditional, and we are not logging this request. Just invoke the wrapped service directly.

Option is a function that can set an option on the parser. It returns the previous setting as an Option. MaxExpressions creates an Option to stop parsing after the provided number of expressions have been parsed, if the value is 0 then the parser will parse for as many steps as needed (possibly an infinite number). The default for maxExprCnt is 0. Entrypoint creates an Option to set the rule name to use as entrypoint. The rule name must have been specified in the -alternate-entrypoints if generating the parser with the -optimize-grammar flag, otherwise it may have been optimized out. Passing an empty string sets the entrypoint to the first rule in the grammar. The default is to start parsing at the first rule in the grammar. Statistics adds a user provided Stats struct to the parser to allow the user to process the results after the parsing has finished. Also the key for the "no match" counter is set. Example usage:     input := "input"     stats := Stats{}     _, err := Parse("input-file", []byte(input), Statistics(&stats, "no match"))     if err != nil {         log.Panicln(err)     b, err := json.MarshalIndent(stats.ChoiceAltCnt, "", "  ")     fmt.Println(string(b)) Debug creates an Option to set the debug flag to b. When set to true, debugging information is printed to stdout while parsing. The default is false. Memoize creates an Option to set the memoize flag to b. When set to true, the parser will cache all results so each expression is evaluated only once. This guarantees linear parsing time even for pathological cases, at the expense of more memory and slower times for typical cases. AllowInvalidUTF8 creates an Option to allow invalid UTF-8 bytes. Every invalid UTF-8 byte is treated as a utf8.RuneError (U+FFFD) by character class matchers and is matched by the any matcher. The returned matched value, c.text and c.offset are NOT affected. Recover creates an Option to set the recover flag to b. When set to true, this causes the parser to recover from panics and convert it to an error. Setting it to false can be useful while debugging to access the full stack trace. The default is true. GlobalStore creates an Option to set a key to a certain value in the globalStore. InitState creates an Option to set a key to a certain value in the global "state" store. ParseFile parses the file identified by filename. ParseReader parses the data from r using filename as information in the error messages. Parse parses the data from b using filename as information in the position records a position in the text. savepoint stores all state required to go back to this point in the parser. start position of the match raw text of the match state is a store for arbitrary key,value pairs that the user wants to be tied to the backtracking of the parser. This is always rolled back if a parsing rule fails. globalStore is a general store for the user to store arbitrary key-value pairs that they need to manage and that they do not want tied to the backtracking of the parser. This is only modified by the user and never rolled back by the parser. It is always up to the user to keep this in a consistent state. the AST types... errList cumulates the errors found by the parser. parserError wraps an error with a prefix indicating the rule in which the error occurred. The original error is stored in the Inner field. Error returns the error message. newParser creates a parser with the specified input source and options. start rule is rule [0] unless an alternate entrypoint is specified setOptions applies the options to the parser. Stats stores some statistics, gathered during parsing ExprCnt counts the number of expressions processed during parsing This value is compared to the maximum number of expressions allowed (set by the MaxExpressions option). ChoiceAltCnt is used to count for each ordered choice expression, which alternative is used how may times. These numbers allow to optimize the order of the ordered choice expression to increase the performance of the parser The outer key of ChoiceAltCnt is composed of the name of the rule as well as the line and the column of the ordered choice. The inner key of ChoiceAltCnt is the number (one-based) of the matching alternative. For each alternative the number of matches are counted. If an ordered choice does not match, a special counter is incremented. The name of this counter is set with the parser option Statistics. For an alternative to be included in ChoiceAltCnt, it has to match at least once. memoization table for the packrat algorithm: map[offset in source] map[expression or rule] {value, match} rules table, maps the rule identifier to the rule node variables stack, map of label to value rule stack, allows identification of the current rule in errors parse fail max number of expressions to be parsed entrypoint for the parser recovery expression stack, keeps track of the currently available recovery expression, these are traversed in reverse push a variable set on the vstack. create new empty slot in the stack slice to 1 more get the last args set empty map, all good pop a variable set from the vstack. if the map is not empty, clear it GC that map push a recovery expression with its labels to the recoveryStack pop a recovery expression from the recoveryStack process fail if parsing fails and not inverted or parsing succeeds and invert is set read advances the parser to the next rune. see utf8.DecodeRune restore parser position to the savepoint pt. Cloner is implemented by any value that has a Clone method, which returns a copy of the value. This is mainly used for types which are not passed by value (e.g map, slice, chan) or structs that contain such types. This is used in conjunction with the global state feature to create proper copies of the state to allow the parser to properly restore the state in the case of backtracking. clone and return parser current state. restore parser current state to the state storeDict. every restoreState should applied only one time for every cloned state get the slice of bytes from the savepoint start to the current position. TODO : not super critical but this could be generated panic can be used in action code to stop parsing immediately and return the panic as an error. advance to first rune If parsing fails, but no errors have been recorded, the expected values for the farthest parser position are returned as error.

Logical operations cannot be executed by the query engine. So if this operation is still around post physical planning, it means that a 'range' could not be pushed down to storage.

Note the columns _start and _stop are ok since all tables coming from storage will have the same _start and _values. PushDownRangeRule pushes down a range filter to storage Pattern matches 'from |> range' Rewrite converts 'from |> range' into 'ReadRange' PushDownFilterRule is a rule that pushes filters into from procedures to be evaluated in the storage layer. This rule is likely to be replaced by a more generic rule when we have a better framework for pushing filters, etc into sources. Cannot push down when keeping empty tables. I would expect that type checking would catch this, but just to be safe... Nothing could be pushed down, no rewrite can happen Convert the pushable expression to a storage predicate. If the filter has already been set, then combine the existing predicate with the new one. Copy the specification and set the predicate. All predicates could be pushed down, so eliminate the filter PushDownReadTagKeysRule matches 'ReadRange |> keys() |> keep() |> distinct()'. The 'from()' must have already been merged with 'range' and, optionally, may have been merged with 'filter'. If any other properties have been set on the from procedure, this rule will not rewrite anything. Retrieve the nodes and specs for all of the predecessors. A filter spec would have already been merged into the from spec if it existed so we will take that one when constructing our own replacement. We do not care about it at the moment though which is why it is not in the pattern. The schema mutator needs to correspond to a keep call on the column specified by the keys procedure. We have a keep mutator, but it uses a function or it retains more than one column so it does not match what we want. We are not keeping the value column so this optimization will not work. The distinct spec should keep only the value column. We have passed all of the necessary prerequisites so construct the procedure spec. PushDownReadTagValuesRule matches 'ReadRange |> keep(columns: [tag]) |> group() |> distinct(column: tag)'. All of the values need to be grouped into the same table. The column that distinct is for will be the tag key. on the tag key column. isValidTagKeyForTagValues returns true if the given key can be used in a tag values call. isPushableExpr determines if a predicate expression can be pushed down into the storage layer. TODO(jsternberg): We should be able to rewrite `not r.host == "tag"` to `r.host != "tag"` but that is beyond what we do right now. Manual testing seems to indicate that (at least right now) we can only handle predicates of the form <fn param>.<property> <op> <literal> and the literal must be on the RHS. If the predicate is a string literal, we are comparing for equality, it is a tag, and it is empty, then it is not pushable. This is because the storage engine does not consider there a difference between a tag with an empty value and a non-existant tag. We have made the decision that a missing tag is null and not an empty string, so empty string isn't something that can be returned from the storage layer. The string literal is pushable if the operator is != because != "" will evaluate to true with everything that has a tag value and false when the tag value is null. rewritePushableExpr will rewrite the expression for the storage layer. Fields can be filtered by anything that tags can be filtered by, plus range operators. SortedPivotRule is a rule that optimizes a pivot when it is directly after an influxdb from. The only thing that disqualifies this from being sorted is if the _value column is mentioned or if the tag does not exist. Everything else is a tag. Even if the tag does not exist, this is still considered sorted since sorting doesn't depend on a tag existing. We are already sorted. Everything else would be a tag if it existed. The transformation itself will catch if the column does not exist. Push Down of window aggregates. ReadRangePhys |> window |> { min, max, mean, count, sum } Check the aggregate function spec. Require the operation on _value and check the feature flag associated with the aggregate function. every and period must be equal every.isNegative must be false offset.isNegative must be false timeColumn: must be "_time" startColumn: must be "_start" stopColumn: must be "_stop" createEmpty: must be false Rule passes. PushDownWindowAggregateWithTimeRule will match the given pattern. ReadWindowAggregatePhys |> duplicate |> window(every: inf) If this pattern matches and the arguments to duplicate are matching time column names, it will set the time column on the spec. The As field must be the default time value and the column must be start or stop. window(every: inf) Cannot rewrite if already was rewritten. PushDownBareAggregateRule is a rule that allows pushing down of aggregates that are directly over a ReadRange source. GroupWindowAggregateTransposeRule will match the given pattern. ReadGroupPhys |> window |> { min, max, count, sum } This pattern will use the PushDownWindowAggregateRule to determine if the ReadWindowAggregatePhys operation is available before it will rewrite the above. This rewrites the above to: ReadWindowAggregatePhys |> group(columns: ["_start", "_stop", ...]) |> { min, max, sum } The count aggregate uses sum to merge the results. This only works with GroupModeBy. It is the case that ReadGroup, which we depend on as a predecessor, only works with GroupModeBy so it should be impossible to fail this condition, but we add this here for extra protection. Perform the rewrite by replacing each of the nodes. Replace the window node with a group node first. Attach the existing function node to the new group node. Replace the spec for the function if needed. No replacement required. The procedure is idempotent so we can use it over and over again and get the same result. Push Down of group aggregates. ReadGroupPhys |> { count } Cannot push down multiple aggregates ReadGroup() -> count => ReadGroup(count) ReadGroup() -> sum => ReadGroup(sum) ReadGroup() -> first => ReadGroup(first) ReadGroup() -> last => ReadGroup(last) ReadGroup() -> min => ReadGroup(min) ReadGroup() -> max => ReadGroup(max)/Users/austinjaybecker/projects/abeck-go-testing/query/stdlib/influxdata/influxdb/source.goctxWithSpanbufTableIsQueryTracingEnabledsource-"source-"influxdb/scanned-bytes"influxdb/scanned-bytes"influxdb/scanned-values"influxdb/scanned-values"BufferedTableBufferNCopyTablereadFilter"readFilter"nil bounds passed to from"nil bounds passed to from"readTagKeys"readTagKeys"readTagValues"readTagValues" Track the number of bytes and values scanned.

Used to create IDs for organizations and buckets. It is implemented without those characters because orgbucket pairs are placed in the old measurement field.  Measurement was interpreted as a string delimited with commas.  Therefore, to continue to use the underlying storage engine we need to sanitize ids. Safe for concurrent use by multiple goroutines. NewOrgBucketID creates an influxdb.IDGenerator that creates random numbers seeded with seed.  Ascii backslash, comma, and space are manipulated by incrementing.

Also note that if in the future we will add support for mean, then it should also fall onto this branch. No matter this has aggregate, selector, or neither, the first two columns are always _start and _stop For the group without aggregate or with selector case: Aggregate has no _time From now on, only include group keys that are not _start and _stop. which are already included as the first two columns This highly depends on the implementation of groupKeyForGroup() which put _start and _stop into the first two slots. the starting columns index for other group key columns is 3 (1+j) isSelector returns true if given a procedure kind that represents a selector operator.

If the buffer is still being used because the references were retained, then we will allocate a new buffer. window table createNextBufferTimes will read the timestamps from the array cursor and construct the values for the next buffer. There are no more windows when the start time is greater than or equal to the stop time. Create a buffer with the buffer size. TODO(jsternberg): Calculate the exact size with max points as the maximum. Retrieve the next buffer so we can copy the timestamps. Copy over the timestamps from the next buffer and adjust times for the boundaries. nextAt will retrieve the next value that can be used with the given stop timestamp. If no values can be used with the timestamp, it will return the default value and false. isInWindow will check if the given time at stop can be used within the window stop time for ts. The ts may be a truncated stop time because of a restricted boundary while stop will be the true stop time returned by storage. This method checks if the stop time is a valid stop time for that interval. This calculation is different from the calculation of the window itself. For example, for a 10 second window that starts at 20 seconds, we would include points between [20, 30). The stop time for this interval would be 30, but because the stop time can be truncated, valid stop times range from anywhere between (20, 30]. The storage engine will always produce 30 as the end time but we may have truncated the stop time because of the boundary and this is why we are checking for this range instead of checking if the two values are equal. nextBuffer will ensure the array cursor is filled and will return true if there is at least one value that can be read from it. Discard the current array cursor if we have exceeded it. Retrieve the next array cursor if needed. appendValues will scan the timestamps and append values that match those timestamps from the buffer. Create the timestamps for the next window. This table implementation will not have any empty windows. This table implementation may contain empty windows in addition to non-empty windows. The first window should start at the beginning of the time range. If the current timestamp falls within the current window, append the value to the builder, otherwise append a null value. If the current array is non-empty and has been read in its entirety, call Next(). The last window should stop at the end of the time range. group table For group aggregates, we will try to get all the series and all table buffers within those series all at once and merge them into one row when this advance() function is first called. At the end of this process, t.advanceCursor() already returns false and t.cur becomes nil. But we still need to return true to indicate that there is data to be returned. The second time when we call this advance(), t.cur is already nil, so we directly return false. handle the group without aggregate case determineFloatAggregateMethod returns the method for aggregating returned points within the same group. The incoming points are the ones returned for each series and the method returned here will aggregate the aggregates. For group count and sum, the timestamp here is always math.MaxInt64. their final result does not contain _time, so this timestamp value can be anything and it won't matter.

If the existing buffer is not used anymore, then it may be reused. The allocated buffer can be accessed at colBufs or through the returned colReader. The current buffer is still being used so we should generate a new one. readTags populates b.tags with the provided tags In the case of group aggregate, tags that are not referenced in group() are not included in the result, but readTags () still get a complete tag list.

An lru is used to keep track of the least recently used item in the cache so that it can be ejected. An lru is used here because we cannot be certain if tag values are going to be used again and we do not want to retain a reference that may have already been released. This makes an lru a good fit since it will be more likely to eject a value that is not going to be used again than another data structure. The increase in performance by reusing arrays for tag values is dependent on the order of the tags coming out of storage. It is possible that a value will be reused but could get ejected from the cache before it would be reused. The map contains the tag **values** and not the tag keys. An array can get shared among two different tag keys that have the same value. newTagsCache will create a tags cache that will retain the last sz entries. If zero, the default will be used. GetBounds will return arrays that match with the bounds. If an array that is within the cache works with the bounds and can be sliced to the length, a reference to it will be returned. Retrieve the columns from the cache if they exist. If we could not retrieve an array from the cache, create one here outside of the lock. Record that we will need to replace the values in the cache. No need to retrieve the write lock. Return now since we retrieved all values from getBoundsFromCache will return an array of values if the array in the cache is of the appropriate size. This must be called from inside of a lock. If the lengths do not match, but the cached array is less than the desired array, then we can use slice. NewSlice will automatically create a new reference to the passed in array so we do not need to manually retain. replaceBounds will examine the array and replace it if the length of the array is greater than the current array or if there isn't an array in the cache. This must be called from inside of a write lock. The cached value is longer so just keep it. createBounds will create an array of times for the given time with the given length. DO NOT CALL THIS METHOD IN A LOCK. It is slow and will probably cause lock contention. GetTag returns a binary arrow array that contains the value repeated l times. If an array with a length greater than or equal to the length and with the same value exists in the cache, a reference to the data will be retained and returned. Otherwise, the allocator will be used to construct a new column. Attempt to retrieve the array from the cache. The array is not in the cache so create it. getTagFromCache will return an array of values with the specified value at the specified length. If there is no cache entry or the entry is not large enough for the specified length, then this returns false. Slice will automatically create a new reference to the touchOrReplaceTag will update the LRU cache to have the value specified by the array as the most recently used entry. If the cache entry does not exist or the current array in the cache is shorter than this one, it will replace the array. If the array in the cache is longer to or equal to the current tag, then do not touch it. Retain this array again and release our previous reference to the other array. Move this element to the front of the lru. maintainLRU will ensure the lru cache maintains the appropriate length by ejecting the least recently used value from the cache until the cache is the appropriate size.

NewFluxCompiler wraps a Flux query string in a raw-query representation. TODO(brett): This mitigates an immediate problem where Checks/Notifications breaks when sending Now, and system Tasks do not break when sending Now. We are currently sending C+N through using Flux Compiler and Tasks as AST Compiler until we come to the root cause. Removing Now here will keep the system humming along normally until we are able to locate the root cause and use Flux Compiler for all Task types. It turns out this is due to the exclusive nature of the stop time in Flux "from" and that we weren't including the left-hand boundary of the range check for notifications. We're shipping a fix soon in https://github.com/influxdata/influxdb/pull/19392 Once this has merged, we can send Now again.

Executor is a system used by the scheduler to actually execute the scheduleable item. Execute is used to execute run's for any schedulable object. the executor can go through manual runs, clean currently running, and then create a new run based on `now`. if Now is zero we can just do the first 2 steps (This is how we would trigger manual runs). Errors returned from the execute request imply that this attempt has failed and should be put back in scheduler and re executed at a alter time. We will add scheduler specific errors so the time can be configurable. Schedulable is the interface that encapsulates work that is to be executed on a specified schedule. ID is the unique identifier for this Schedulable Schedule defines the frequency for which this Schedulable should be queued for execution. Offset defines a negative or positive duration that should be added to the scheduled time, resulting in the instance running earlier or later than the scheduled time. LastScheduled specifies last time this Schedulable was queued for execution. SchedulableService encapsulates the work necessary to schedule a job UpdateLastScheduled notifies the instance that it was scheduled for execution at the specified time Align create to the hour/minute We cannot align a invalid time drop nanoseconds and align Schedule is an object a valid schedule of runs Next returns the next time after from that a schedule should trigger on. ValidSchedule returns an error if the cron string is invalid.

It calls Executor in-order per ID.  That means you are guaranteed that for a specific ID, - The scheduler should, after creation, automatically call ExecutorFunc, when a task should run as defined by its Schedulable. - the scheduler's should not be able to get into a state where blocks Release and Schedule indefinitely. - Schedule should add a Schedulable to being scheduled, and Release should remove a task from being scheduled. - Calling of ExecutorFunc should be serial in time on a per taskID basis. I.E.: the run at 12:00 will go before the run at 12:01. Design: The core of the scheduler is a btree keyed by time, a nonce, and a task ID, and a map keyed by task ID and containing a nonce and a time (called a uniqueness index from now on). The map is to ensure task uniqueness in the tree, so we can replace or delete tasks in the tree. Scheduling in the tree consists of a main loop that feeds a fixed set of workers, each with their own communication channel. Distribution is handled by hashing the TaskID (to ensure uniform distribution) and then distributing over those channels evenly based on the hashed ID.  This is to ensure that all tasks of the same ID go to the same worker.The workers call ExecutorFunc handle any errors and update the LastScheduled time internally and also via the Checkpointer. The main loop: The main loop waits on a time.Timer to grab the task with the minimum time.  Once it successfully grabs a task ready to trigger, it will start walking the btree from the item nearest Putting a task into the scheduler: Adding a task to the scheduler acquires a write lock, grabs the task from the uniqueness map, and replaces the item in the uniqueness index and btree.  If new task would trigger sooner than the current soonest triggering task, it replaces the Timer when added to the scheduler.  Finally it releases the write lock. Removing a task from the scheduler: Removing a task from the scheduler acquires a write lock, deletes the task from the uniqueness index and from the btree, then releases the lock.  We do not have to readjust the time on delete, because, if the minimum task isn't ready yet, the main loop just resets the timer and keeps going. we need this index so we can delete items from the scheduled ErrorFunc is a function for error handling.  It is a good way to inject logging into a TreeScheduler. WithOnErrorFn is an option that sets the error function that gets called when there is an error in a TreeScheduler. its useful for injecting logging or special error handling. WithMaxConcurrentWorkers is an option that sets the max number of concurrent workers that a TreeScheduler will use. WithTime is an option for NewScheduler that allows you to inject a clock.Clock from ben johnson's github.com/benbjohnson/clock library, for testing purposes. NewScheduler gives us a new TreeScheduler and SchedulerMetrics when given an  Executor, a SchedulableService, and zero or more options. Schedulers should be initialized with this function. apply options because a stopped timer will wait forever, this allows us to wait for items to be added before triggering. close workchans this for loop is a work around to the way clock's mock works when you reset duration 0 in a different thread than you are calling your clock.Set grab a new item, because there could be a different item at the top of the queue grab a new item, because there could be a different item at the top of the queue after processing we can reset without a stop because we know it is fired here itemList is a list of items for deleting and inserting.  We have to do them separately instead of just a re-add, because usually the items key must be changed between the delete and insert Reset the length of the slice in preparation of the next iterator. we want it to panic if things other than Items are populating the scheduler, as it is something we can't recover from. distribute to the right worker. we just hash so that the number is uniformly distributed in this error case we can't schedule next, so we have to drop the task When gives us the next time the scheduler will run a task. delete the old task run time Release releases a task. Release also cancels the running task. Task deletion would be faster if the tree supported deleting ranges. work does work from the channel and checkpoints it. report the difference between when the item was supposed to be scheduled and now execute report how long execution took TODO(docmerlin): we can increase performance by making the call to UpdateLastScheduled async Schedule put puts a Schedulable on the TreeScheduler.last:   sch.LastScheduled().Unix(), insert the new task run time Item is a task in the scheduler.

Options are the task-related options that can be specified in a Flux script. Name is a non optional name designator for each task. Cron is a cron style time schedule that can be used in place of Every. Every represents a fixed period to repeat execution. this can be unmarshaled from json as a string i.e.: "1d" will unmarshal as 1 day Duration is a time span that supports the same units as the flux parser's time duration, as well as negative length time spans. Parse parses a string into a Duration. MustParseDuration parses a string and returns a duration.  It panics if there is an error. UnmarshalText unmarshals text into a Duration. MarshalText marshals text into a Duration. IsZero checks if each segment of the duration is zero, it doesn't check if the Duration sums to zero, just if each internal duration is zero. DurationFrom gives us a time.Duration from a time. Currently because of how flux works, this is just an approfimation for any time unit larger than hours. Add adds the duration to a time. Clear clears out all options in the options struct, it us useful if you wish to reuse it. IsZero tells us if the options has been zeroed out. All the task option names we accept. contains is a helper function to see if an array of strings contains a string we preallocate two keys for the map, as that is how many we will use at maximum (offset and every) FromScriptAST extracts Task options from a Flux script using only the AST (no evaluation of the script). Using AST here allows us to avoid having to contend with functions that aren't available in some parsing contexts (within Gateway for example). hasDuplicateOptions determines whether or not there are multiple assignments to the same option variable. TODO(brett): This will be superceded by edit.HasDuplicateOptions once its available. FromScript extracts Options from a Flux script. TODO(desa): should be dependencies.NewEmpty(), but for now we'll hack things together pull options from the program scope check to make sure task is an object Validate returns an error if the options aren't valid. They're both present or both missing. For now, allowing negative offset delays. Maybe they're useful for forecasting? EffectiveCronString returns the effective cron string of the options. If the cron option was specified, it is returned. If the every option was specified, it is converted into a cron string using "@every". Otherwise, the empty string is returned. The value of the offset option is not considered. TODO(docmerlin): create an EffectiveCronStringFrom(t time.Time) string, that works from a unit of time. Do not use this if you haven't checked for validity already. we can ignore errors here because we have already checked for validity. checkNature returns a clean error of got and expected dont match. validateOptionNames returns an error if any keys in the option object o do not match an expected option name.

Consumers of this package must import query/builtin. This package does not import it directly, to avoid requiring it too early. BackendComponentFactory is supplied by consumers of the adaptertest package, to provide the values required to constitute a PlatformAdapter. The provided context.CancelFunc is called after the test, and it is the implementer's responsibility to clean up after that is called. If creating the System fails, the implementer should call t.Fatal. TestTaskService should be called by consumers of the servicetest package. This will call fn once to create a single influxdb.TaskService used across all subtests in TestTaskService. We're running the subtests in parallel, but if we don't use this wrapper, the defer cancel() call above would return before the parallel subtests completed. Running the subtests in parallel might make them slightly faster, but more importantly, it should exercise concurrency to catch data races. TestCreds encapsulates credentials needed for a system to properly work with tasks. Authorizer returns an authorizer for the credentials in the struct System  as in "system under test" encapsulates the required parts of a influxdb.TaskAdapter Used in the Creds function to create valid organizations, users, tokens, etc. Set this context, to be used in tests, so that any spawned goroutines watching Ctx.Done() will clean up after themselves. TaskService is the task service we would like to test Override for accessing credentials for an individual test. Callers can leave this nil and the test will create its own random IDs for each test. However, if the system needs to verify credentials, the caller should set this value and return valid IDs and a valid token. It is safe if this returns the same values every time it is called. Toggles behavior between KV and archive storage because FinishRun() deletes runs after completion Create a task. TODO: replace with ErrMissingOwner test // should not be able to create a task without a token noToken := influxdb.TaskCreate{ 	OrganizationID: cr.OrgID, 	Flux:           fmt.Sprintf(scriptFmt, 0), 	// OwnerID:          cr.UserID, // should fail _, err = sys.TaskService.CreateTask(authorizedCtx, noToken) if err != influxdb.ErrMissingToken { 	t.Fatalf("expected error missing token, got: %v", err) Look up a task the different ways we can.

The platform adapter is currently hardcoded to schedule after "now", which makes timing of runs somewhat difficult. check run filter errors This should guarantee we can make two runs. Update the run state to Started; normally the scheduler would do this. Mark the second run finished. Limit 1 should only return the earlier run. Look for a run that doesn't exist. look for a taskID that doesn't exist. set to one hour before now because of bucket retention policy create runs to put into Context setting run in memory to match the fields in Context Analytical storage does not store run at Forcing the same run before it's executed should be rejected. This should guarantee we can make a run. Create two runs. Add a log for the first run. Ensure it is returned when filtering logs by run ID. Add a log for the second run. Ensure both returned when filtering logs by task ID. Arbitrarily chosen to get a reasonable count of concurrent creates and deletes. Since this test is run in parallel with other tests, we need to keep a whitelist of IDs that are okay to delete. This only matters when the creds function returns an identical user/org from another test. Signal for non-creator goroutines to stop. Get all the tasks, and delete the first one we find. Check if we need to quit. Get all the tasks. Check again if we need to quit. Was the retrieved task an ID we're allowed to delete? Task was in whitelist. Delete it from the TaskService. We could remove it from the taskIDs map, but this test is short-lived enough that clearing out the map isn't really worth taking the lock again. Wait just a tiny bit. Create a run for the last task we found. The script should run every minute, so use max now. This may have errored due to the task being deleted. Check if the task still exists. It was deleted. Just continue. Otherwise, we were able to find the task, so something went wrong here. Start adding tasks. Done adding. Wait for cleanup. Create 3rd run and test limiting to 2 runs Unspecified limit returns all three runs, sorted by most recently scheduled first. TODO (al): handle empty finishedAt if runs[0].FinishedAt != "" { 	t.Fatalf("expected empty FinishedAt, got %q", runs[0].FinishedAt) Script is set to run every minute. Non-existent ID should return the right error. Update the run state to Started then Failed; normally the scheduler would do this. Now retry the run. Retrying a run which has been queued but not started, should be rejected. Create several run logs in both rc0 and rc1 We can then finalize rc1 and ensure that both the transactional (currently running logs) can be found with analytical (completed) logs. t.Helper() Create a tasks get system tasks (or task's with no type) get filtered tasks get all tasks/Users/austinjaybecker/projects/abeck-go-testing/task.gojooldFluxeditFuncparsedPKGoptsExprtaskOptionsjson:"runAt"`json:"runAt"`json:"runID,omitempty"`json:"runID,omitempty"`missing flux"missing flux"missing orgID and org"missing orgID and org"invalid task status: %q"invalid task status: %q"json:"flux,omitempty"`json:"flux,omitempty"`cannot specify both every and cron"cannot specify both every and cron"every: %s is invalid"every: %s is invalid"offset: %s, %s is invalid, the largest unit supported is h"offset: %s, %s is invalid, the largest unit supported is h"cannot update task without content"cannot update task without content"flux parser is not configured; updating a task requires the flux parser to be set"flux parser is not configured; updating a task requires the flux parser to be set"internal error in flux engine; unable to parse"internal error in flux engine; unable to parse"cannot specify both cron and every"cannot specify both cron and every"option assignment must be variable assignment"option assignment must be variable assignment"value is is %s, not an object expression"value is is %s, not an object expression"OptionFnunable to edit option"unable to edit option"DeletePropertyunknown RunStatus: %d"unknown RunStatus: %d"previous retry for start=%s end=%s has not yet finished"previous retry for start=%s end=%s has not yet finished"Sscanf TODO(jsteenb2): make these constants of type Status TaskSystemType is the type set in tasks' for all crud requests Task is a task. 🎊 EffectiveCron returns the effective cron string of the options.

TaskCreate is the set of values to create a task. not to be set through a web request but rather used by a http service using tasks backend. TaskUpdate represents updates to a task. Options updates override any options set in the Flux field.

It is used mostly internally. ErrTaskNotClaimed is returned when attempting to operate against a task that must be claimed but is not. ErrTaskAlreadyClaimed is returned when attempting to operate against a task that must not be claimed but is. ErrNoRunsFound is returned when searching for a range of runs, but none are found. ErrInvalidTaskID error object for bad id's ErrTaskNotFound indicates no task could be found for given parameters. ErrRunNotFound is returned when searching for a single run that doesn't exist. ErrPageSizeTooLarge indicates the page size is too large. This error is only used in the kv task service implementation. The name of this error may lead it to be used in a place that is not useful. The TaskMaxPageSize is the only one at 500, the rest at 100. This would likely benefit from a more specific name since those limits aren't shared globally. ErrOutOfBoundsLimit is returned with FindRuns is called with an invalid filter limit.

The tenant domain encapsulates all the storage critical metadata services:
User
Organization
Bucket
URM's

These services are the cornerstone of all other metadata services. The intent is to have
a single location for all tenant related code. THis should facilitate faster bug resolution and
allow us to make changes to this service without effecting any dependant services.

When a new request for the tenant service comes in it should follow this pattern:
1 http_server_resource - this is where the request is parsed and rejected if the client didn't send
	the right information
2 middleware_resource_auth - We now confirm the user that generated the request has sufficient permission
	to accomplish this task, in some cases we adjust the request if the user is without the correct permissions
3 middleware_resource_metrics - Track RED metrics for this request
4 middleware_resource_logging - add logging around request duration and status.
5 service_resource - When a request reaches the service we verify the content for compatibility with the existing dataset,
	for instance if a resource has a "orgID" we will ensure the organization exists
6 storage_resource - Basic CRUD actions for the system.

This pattern of api -> middleware -> service -> basic crud helps us to break down the responsibilities into digestible
chunks and allows us to swap in or out any pieces we need depending on the situation. Currently the storage layer is using
a kv store but by breaking the crud actions into its own independent set of concerns we allow ourselves to move away from kv
if the need arises without having to be concerned about messing up some other pieces of logic.

These tests stress the relation between the services embedded by the TenantService. The individual functionality of services is tested elsewhere. Create tests various cases of creation for the services in the TenantService. For example, when you create a user, do you create system buckets? How are URMs organized? Blank fields, we are testing creation. NOTE(affo)(*kv.Service): tests that contain s.CreateOrganization() generate error in logs:   Failed to make user owner of organization: {"error": "could not find authorizer on context when adding user to resource type orgs"}. This happens because kv requires an authorization to be in context. This is a bad dependency pattern (store -> auth) and should not be there. Anyways this does not prevent the org to be created. If you add the urm manually you'll obtain the same result. NOTE(affo)(*kv.Service): it also creates urms for the non existing user found in context. Check existence NOTE(affo)(*kv.Service): nope, it does create system buckets with invalid OrgIDs. Number of buckets prior to user creation. This is because, for now, system buckets always get returned for compatibility with the old system. Compare new number of buckets with the one prior to user creation. NOTE(affo)(*kv.Service): nope, it does create a useless URM, no existence check.  Apparently, system buckets are created too :thinking. First create an org and a user. Wrong userID. Wrong orgID. The URM gets created successfully. NOTE(affo)(*kv.Service): errors on bucket creation.  But, apparently, system buckets are created too :thinking. Number of buckets prior to bucket creation. Compare new number of buckets with the one prior to bucket creation. Now add a new bucket and check the URMs. Delete tests various cases of deletion for the services in the TenantService. An example: if you delete a bucket the corresponding user resource mapping is not present. URM are userID + resourceID (they do not include resource type) so same IDs across different resources leads to collisions therefore, we need to start bucket IDs at higher offset for test. 2 organizations create 2 system buckets each so start at 14 ID(14) ID(15) NOTE(affo): bucket URMs should not be here, create them only for deletion purposes. user 1 owns org1 (and so bucket1) user 1 is member of org2 (and so bucket2) user 2 owns org2 (and so bucket2) NOTE(affo): those resources could not be dangling (URM could be inferred from an user being in the owner org). We do not want to automatically propagate this kind of delete because an resource will always have an owner org. Pre-check the current situation. bucket1 is owned by user1. Check it. bucket2 is owned by user2. bucket2 is readable by user2. Now delete user2 -> bucket2. Still expect bucket2 to exist (user1 still points to it). Now delete user1 -> bucket2. Still expect bucket2 to exist (nobody points to it). Now delete user1 -> bucket1. Still expect bucket1 to exist (nobody points to it). Delete user1. We expect his urms deleted but not bucket1. Delete bucket2. We expect its urms deleted. NOTE(affo)(*kv.Service): buckets, users, and urms survive. Delete org1. We expect its buckets to be deleted. We expect urms to those buckets to be deleted too. No user should be deleted. Delete org2. Everything should disappear./Users/austinjaybecker/projects/abeck-go-testing/testing/user_resource_mapping_service.go"CreateUserResourceMapping""FindUserResourceMappings""DeleteUserResourceMapping"basic create user resource mapping"basic create user resource mapping"duplicate mappings are not allowed"duplicate mappings are not allowed"failed to retrieve mappings: %v"failed to retrieve mappings: %v"mappings are different -got/+want

Client provides an API for writing, querying, and interacting with resources like authorizations, buckets, and organizations. NewClient initialises a new Client which is ready to write points to the HTTP write endpoint. Open opens the client Close closes the client MustWriteBatch calls WriteBatch, panicking if an error is encountered. WriteBatch writes the current batch of points to the HTTP endpoint. Query returns the CSV response from a flux query to the HTTP API. This also remove all the \r to make it easier to write tests. remove the \r to simplify testing against a body of CSV. This is the only namespace for documents present after init. QueryRequestBody creates a body for a flux query using common CSV output params. Headers are included, but, annotations are not. MustCreateAuth creates an auth  or is a fatal error. Used in tests where the content of the bucket does not matter. This authorization token is an operator token for the default organization for the default user. MustCreateBucket creates a bucket or is a fatal error. MustCreateOrg creates an org or is a fatal error. Used in tests where the content of the org does not matter. MustCreateLabel creates a label or is a fatal error. Used in tests where the content of the label does not matter. MustCreateCheck creates a check or is a fatal error. Used in tests where the content of the check does not matter. MustCreateTelegraf creates a telegraf config or is a fatal error. Used in tests where the content of the telegraf config does not matter. this id is not used in the API  MustCreateUser creates a user or is a fatal error. Used in tests where the content of the user does not matter. MustCreateVariable creates a variable or is a fatal error. Used in tests where the content of the variable does not matter. MustCreateNotificationEndpoint creates a notification endpoint or is a fatal error. Used in tests where the content of the notification endpoint does not matter. MustCreateNotificationRule creates a Notification Rule or is a fatal error Used in tests where the content of the notification rule does not matter we don't need this endpoint, so delete it to be compatible with other tests MustCreateDBRPMapping creates a DBRP Mapping or is a fatal error. Used in tests where the content of the mapping does not matter. The created mapping points to the user's default bucket. MustCreateResource will create a generic resource via the API. Used in tests where the content of the resource does not matter.  // Create one of each org resource  for _, r := range influxdb.OrgResourceTypes {      client.MustCreateResource(t, r)  // Create a variable:  id := client.MustCreateResource(t, influxdb.VariablesResourceType)  defer client.MustDeleteResource(t, influxdb.VariablesResourceType, id) DeleteResource will remove a resource using the API. Ignore the other results as suggested by goDoc. MustDeleteResource requires no error when deleting a resource. FindAll returns all the IDs of a specific resource type. MustFindAll returns all the IDs of a specific resource type; any error is fatal. AddOwner associates the user as owner of the resource. MustAddOwner requires that the user is associated with the resource or the test will be stopped fatally. AddMember associates the user as member of the resource. MustAddMember requires that the user is associated with the resource RemoveURM removes association of the user to the resource. Interestingly the URM service does not make difference on the user type. I.e. removing an URM from a user to a resource, will delete every URM of every type from that user to that resource. Or, put in another way, there can only be one resource mapping from a user to a resource at a time: either you are a member, or an owner (in that case you are a member too). RemoveSpecificURM gets around a client issue where deletes doesn't have enough context to remove a urm from a specific resource type MustRemoveURM requires that the user is removed as owner/member from the resource. CreateLabelMapping creates a label mapping for label `l` to the resource with `id`. MustCreateLabelMapping requires that the label is associated with the resource FindLabelMappings finds the labels for the specified resource. MustFindLabelMappings makes the test fail if an error is found. DeleteLabelMapping deletes the label for the specified resource. MustDeleteLabelMapping makes the test fail if an error is found./Users/austinjaybecker/projects/abeck-go-testing/tests/defaults.gomyorg"myorg"db/rp"db/rp"opertoken"opertoken" Default values created when calling NewPipeline.

DefaultEngine is the default engine for new shards DefaultIndex is the default index for new shards tsdb/engine/wal configuration options Default settings for TSM DefaultCacheMaxMemorySize is the maximum size a shard's cache can reach before it starts rejecting writes. 1GB DefaultCacheSnapshotMemorySize is the size at which the engine will snapshot the cache and write it to a TSM file, freeing up memory 25MB DefaultCacheSnapshotWriteColdDuration is the length of time at which the engine will snapshot the cache and write it to a new TSM file if the shard hasn't received writes or deletes DefaultCompactFullWriteColdDuration is the duration at which the engine will compact all TSM files in a shard if it hasn't received a write or delete DefaultCompactThroughput is the rate limit in bytes per second that we will allow TSM compactions to write to disk. Not that short bursts are allowed to happen at a possibly larger value, set by DefaultCompactThroughputBurst. A value of 0 here will disable compaction rate limiting DefaultCompactThroughputBurst is the rate limit in bytes per second that we will allow TSM compactions to write to disk. If this is not set, the burst value will be set to equal the normal throughput DefaultMaxPointsPerBlock is the maximum number of points in an encoded block in a TSM file DefaultMaxSeriesPerDatabase is the maximum number of series a node can hold per database. This limit only applies to the "inmem" index. DefaultMaxValuesPerTag is the maximum number of values a tag can have within a measurement. DefaultMaxConcurrentCompactions is the maximum number of concurrent full and level compactions that can run at one time.  A value of 0 results in 50% of runtime.GOMAXPROCS(0) used at runtime. DefaultMaxIndexLogFileSize is the default threshold, in bytes, when an index write-ahead log file will compact into an index file. 1MB DefaultSeriesIDSetCacheSize is the default number of series ID sets to cache in the TSI index. DefaultSeriesFileMaxConcurrentSnapshotCompactions is the maximum number of concurrent series partition snapshot compactions that can run at one time. A value of 0 results in runtime.GOMAXPROCS(0). Config holds the configuration for the tsbd package. General WAL configuration options WALFsyncDelay is the amount of time that a write will wait before fsyncing.  A duration greater than 0 can be used to batch up multiple fsync calls.  This is useful for slower disks or when WAL write contention is seen.  A value of 0 fsyncs every write to the WAL. Enables unicode validation on series keys on write. Query logging Compaction options for tsm1 (descriptions above with defaults) Limits MaxSeriesPerDatabase is the maximum number of series a node can hold per database. When this limit is exceeded, writes return a 'max series per database exceeded' error. A value of 0 disables the limit. This limit only applies when using the "inmem" index. MaxValuesPerTag is the maximum number of tag values a single tag key can have within a measurement.  When the limit is exceeded, writes return an error. A value of 0 disables the limit. MaxConcurrentCompactions is the maximum number of concurrent level and full compactions that can be running at one time across all shards.  Compactions scheduled to run when the limit is reached are blocked until a running compaction completes.  Snapshot compactions are not affected by this limit.  A value of 0 limits compactions to runtime.GOMAXPROCS(0). MaxIndexLogFileSize is the threshold, in bytes, when an index write-ahead log file will compact into an index file. Lower sizes will cause log files to be compacted more quickly and result in lower heap usage at the expense of write throughput. Higher sizes will be compacted less frequently, store more series in-memory, and provide higher write throughput. SeriesIDSetCacheSize is the number items that can be cached within the TSI index. TSI caching can help with query performance when the same tag key/value predicates are commonly used on queries. Setting series-id-set-cache-size to 0 disables the cache. SeriesFileMaxConcurrentSnapshotCompactions is the maximum number of concurrent snapshot compactions that can be running at one time across all series partitions in a database. Snapshots scheduled to run when the limit is reached are blocked until a running snapshot completes.  Only snapshot compactions are affected by this limit. A value of 0 limits snapshot compactions to the lesser of 8 (series file partition quantity) and runtime.GOMAXPROCS(0). TSMWillNeed controls whether we hint to the kernel that we intend to page in mmap'd sections of TSM files. This setting defaults to off, as it has been found to be problematic in some cases. It may help users who have slow disks. NewConfig returns the default configuration for tsdb. Validate validates the configuration hold by c.

Write the l least significant bits of vDelta to b, most significant bit first. Full value to write. l least significant bits of v. In this case the current byte is not full. Move 8 MSB to 8 LSB Move written bits out of the way. TODO(edd): Optimise this. It's unlikely we actually have 8 bytes to write. Set a single bit to indicate a value will follow. Set current bit on current byte Write 5 bits of leading. Enough room to write the 5 bits in the current byte? 5 LSB of leading. Move 5 MSB to 8 LSB 5 bits fit into current byte. In this case there are fewer than 5 bits available in current byte. First step is to fill current byte Some of mask will get lost. Second step is to write the lost part of mask into the next byte. Move written bits in previous byte out of way. Recompute current bit. Note that if leading == trailing == 0, then sigbits == 64.  But that value doesn't actually fit into the 6 bits we have. Luckily, we never need to encode 0 significant bits, since that would put us in the other case (vdelta == 0).  So instead we write out a 0 and adjust it back to 64 on unpacking. Move 6 LSB of sigbits to MSB Move 6 MSB to 8 LSB The 6 bits fit into the current byte. In this case there are fewer than 6 bits available in current byte. First step is to fill the current byte. Write to the current bit. Write l remaining bits into current byte. Remove bits written in previous byte out of way. Write final value. Move l LSB into MSB Shift remaining bits and write out in one go. Remove bits written in previous byte. TODO(edd): Optimise this. bitMask contains a lookup table where the index is the number of bits and the value is a mask. The table is always read by ANDing the index with 0x3f, such that if the index is 64, position 0 will be read, which is a 0xffffffffffffffff, thus returning all bits. 00 = 0xffffffffffffffff 01 = 0x0000000000000001 02 = 0x0000000000000003 03 = 0x0000000000000007 ... 62 = 0x3fffffffffffffff 63 = 0x7fffffffffffffff current value trailing zero count meaningful bit count first byte is the compression type; always Gorilla special case: there were no values to decode convert the []float64 to []uint64 to avoid calling math.Float64Frombits, which results in unnecessary moves between Xn registers before moving the value into the float64 slice. This change increased performance from 320 MB/s to 340 MB/s on an Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-6920HQ CPU @ 2.90GHz The bit reader code uses brCachedVal to store up to the next 8 bytes of MSB data read from b. brValidBits stores the number of remaining unread bits starting from the MSB. Before N bits are read from brCachedVal, they are left-rotated N bits, such that they end up in the left-most position. Using bits.RotateLeft64 results in a single instruction on many CPU architectures. This approach permits simple tests, such as for the two control bits:    brCachedVal&1 > 0 The alternative was to leave brCachedValue alone and perform shifts and masks to read specific bits. The original approach looked like the following:    brCachedVal&(1<<(brValidBits&0x3f)) > 0 a buffer of up to the next 8 bytes read from b in MSB order the number of unread bits remaining in brCachedVal Refill brCachedVal, reading up to 8 bytes from b fast path reads 8 bytes directly The expected exit condition is for a uvnan to be decoded. Any other error (EOF) indicates a truncated stream. brValidBits > 0 is impossible to predict, so we place the most likely case inside the if and immediately jump, keeping the instruction pipeline consistently full. This is a similar approach to using the GCC __builtin_expect intrinsic, which modifies the order of branches such that the likely case follows the conditional jump.

Due to a bug in atomic  size needs to be the first word in the struct, as that's the only place where you're guaranteed to be 64-bit aligned on a 32 bit system. See: https://golang.org/pkg/sync/atomic/#pkg-note-BUG snapshots are the cache objects that are currently being written to tsm files they're kept in memory while flushing so they can be queried along with the cache. they are read only and should never be modified This number is the number of pending or failed WriteSnaphot attempts since the last successful one. A one time synchronization used to initial the cache with a store.  Since the store can allocate a a large amount memory across shards, we lazily create it. NewCache returns an instance of a cache which will use a maximum of maxSize bytes of memory. Only used for engine caches, never for snapshots. CacheStatistics hold statistics related to the cache. Statistics returns statistics for periodic monitoring. init initializes the cache and allocates the underlying store.  Once initialized, the store re-used until Freed. Free releases the underlying store and memory held by the Cache. Write writes the set of values for the key to the cache. This function is goroutine-safe. It returns an error if the cache will exceed its max size by adding the new values. Enough room in the cache? Update the cache size and the memory size stat. WriteMulti writes the map of keys and associated values to the cache. This function is goroutine-safe. It returns an error if the cache will exceeded its max size by adding the new values.  The write attempts to write as many values as possible.  If one key fails, the others can still succeed and an error will be returned. maxSize is safe for reading without a lock. We'll optimistially set size here, and then decrement it for write errors. The write failed, hold onto the error and adjust the size delta. Some points in the batch were dropped.  An error is returned so error stat is incremented as well. Update the memory size stat Snapshot takes a snapshot of the current cache, adds it to the slice of caches that are being flushed, and resets the current cache with new values. increment the number of times we tried to do this If no snapshot exists, create a new one, otherwise update the existing snapshot Did a prior snapshot exist that failed?

ClearSnapshot removes the snapshot cache from the list of flushing caches and adjusts the size. reset the snapshot store outside of the write lock decrement the number of bytes in cache Reset the snapshot to a fresh Cache. Size returns the number of point-calcuated bytes the cache currently uses. increaseSize increases size by delta. decreaseSize decreases size by delta. Per sync/atomic docs, bit-flip delta minus one to perform subtraction within AddUint64. MaxSize returns the maximum number of bytes the cache may consume. Keys returns a sorted slice of all keys under management by the cache. Type returns the series type for a key. Values returns a copy of all values, deduped and sorted, for the given key. No values in hot cache or snapshots. Build the sequence of entries that will be returned, in the correct order. Calculate the required size of the destination buffer. guarantee we are deduplicated Any entries? If not, return. Create the buffer, and copy all hot values and snapshots. Individual entries are sorted at this point, so now the code has to check if the resultant buffer will be sorted from start to finish. Delete removes all values for the given keys from the cache. DeleteRange removes the values for all keys containing points with timestamps between between min and max from the cache. TODO(edd): Lock usage could possibly be optimised if necessary. Make sure key exist in the cache, skip if it does not SetMaxSize updates the memory limit of the cache. values returns the values for the key. It assumes the data is already sorted. It doesn't lock the cache but it does read-lock the entry if there is one for the key. values should only be used in compact.go in the CacheKeyIterator.

The files are created by converting write-optimized WAL entries to read-optimized TSM format.  They can also be created from existing TSM files when there are tombstone records that need to be removed, points that were overwritten by later writes and need to updated, or multiple smaller TSM files need to be merged to reduce file counts and improve compression ratios. The compaction process is stream-oriented using multiple readers and iterators.  The resulting stream is written sorted and chunked to allow for one-pass writing of a new TSM file. 2GB CompactionTempExtension is the extension used for temporary files created during compaction. TSMFileExtension is the extension used for TSM files. Error returns the string representation of the error, to satisfy the error interface. CompactionGroup represents a list of files eligible to be compacted together. CompactionPlanner determines what TSM files and WAL segments to include in a given compaction run. ForceFull causes the planner to return a full compaction plan the next time Plan() is called if there are files that could be compacted. DefaultPlanner implements CompactionPlanner using a strategy to roll up multiple generations of TSM files into larger files in stages.  It attempts to minimize the number of TSM files on disk while rolling up a bounder number of files. compactFullWriteColdDuration specifies the length of time after which if no writes have been committed to the WAL, the engine will do a full compaction of the TSM files in this shard. This duration should always be greater than the CacheFlushWriteColdDuration lastPlanCheck is the last time Plan was called lastFindGenerations is the last time findGenerations was run lastGenerations is the last set of generations found by findGenerations forceFull causes the next full plan requests to plan any files that may need to be compacted.  Normally, these files are skipped and scheduled infrequently as the plans are more expensive to run. filesInUse is the set of files that have been returned as part of a plan and might be being compacted.  Two plans should not return the same file at any given time. tsmGeneration represents the TSM files within a generation. 000001-01.tsm, 000001-02.tsm would be in the same generation 000001 each with different sequence numbers. size returns the total size of the files in the generation. compactionLevel returns the level of the files in this generation. Level 0 is always created from the result of a cache compaction.  It generates 1 file with a sequence num of 1.  Level 2 is generated by compacting multiple level 1 files.  Level 3 is generate by compacting multiple level 2 files.  Level 4 is for anything else. count returns the number of files in the generation. hasTombstones returns true if there are keys removed for any of the files. FullyCompacted returns true if the shard is fully compacted. ForceFull causes the planner to return a full compaction plan the next time a plan is requested.  When ForceFull is called, level and optimize plans will not return plans until a full plan is requested and released. PlanLevel returns a set of TSM files to rewrite for a specific level. If a full plan has been requested, don't plan any levels which will prevent the full plan from acquiring them. Determine the generations from all files on disk.  We need to treat a generation conceptually as a single file even though it may be split across several files in sequence. If there is only one generation and no tombstones, then there's nothing to do. Group each generation by level such that two adjacent generations in the same level become part of the same group. See if this generation is orphan'd which would prevent it from being further compacted until a final full compaction runs. Remove any groups in the wrong level PlanOptimize returns all TSM files if they are in different generations in order to optimize the index across TSM files.  Each returned compaction group can be compacted concurrently. Skip the file if it's over the max size and contains a full block and it does not have any tombstones Only optimize level 4 files since using lower-levels will collide with the level planners Skip the group if it's not worthwhile to optimize it Plan returns a set of TSM files to rewrite for level 4 or higher.  The planning returns multiple groups if possible to allow compactions to run concurrently. first check if we should be doing a full compaction because nothing has been written in a long time Reset the full schedule if we planned because of it. We need to look at the level of the next file because it may need to be combined with this generation but won't get picked up on it's own if this generation is skipped.  This allows the most recently created files to get picked up by the full compaction planner and avoids having a few less optimally compressed files. Make sure we have more than 1 file and more than 1 generation don't plan if nothing has changed in the filestore If there is only one generation, return early to avoid re-compacting the same file over and over again. Need to find the ending point for level 4 files.  They will be the oldest files. We scan each generation in descending break once we see a file less than 4. As compactions run, the oldest files get bigger.  We don't want to re-compact them during this planning if they are maxed out so skip over any we see. Skip the file if it's over the max size and contains a full block or the generation is split over multiple files.  In the latter case, that would mean the data in the file spilled over the 2GB limit. This is an edge case that can happen after multiple compactions run.  The files at the beginning can become larger faster than ones after them.  We want to skip those really big ones and just compact the smaller ones until they are closer in size. step is how may files to compact in a group.  We want to clamp it at 4 but also stil return groups smaller than 4. slice off the generations that we'll examine Loop through the generations in groups of size step and see if we can compact all (or some of them as group) Skip compacting this group if there happens to be any lower level files in the middle.  These will get picked up by the level compactors. Skip the file if it's over the max size and it contains a full block With the groups, we need to evaluate whether the group as a whole can be compacted if we don't have enough generations to compact, skip it All the files to be compacted must be compacted in order.  We need to convert each group to the actual set of files in that group to be compacted. findGenerations groups all the TSM files by generation based on their filename, then returns the generations in descending order (newest first). If skipInUse is true, tsm files that are part of an existing compaction plan are not returned. Skip any files that are assigned to a current compaction plan See if the new files are already in use Mark all the new files in use Release removes the files reference in each compaction group allowing new plans to be able to use them. Compactor merges multiple TSM files into new files or writes a Cache into 1 or more TSM files. RateLimit is the limit for disk writes for all concurrent compactions. lastSnapshotDuration is the amount of time the last snapshot took to complete. The channel to signal that any in progress snapshots should be aborted. The channel to signal that any in progress level compactions should be aborted. NewCompactor returns a new instance of Compactor. Open initializes the Compactor. Close disables the Compactor. DisableSnapshots disables the compactor from performing snapshots. EnableSnapshots allows the compactor to perform snapshots. DisableSnapshots disables the compactor from performing compactions. EnableCompactions allows the compactor to perform compactions. WriteSnapshot writes a Cache snapshot to one or more new TSM files. Enable throttling if we have lower cardinality or snapshots are going fast. Write snapshost concurrently if cardinality is relatively high. Special case very high cardinality, use max concurrency and don't throttle writes. See if we were disabled while writing a snapshot compact writes multiple smaller TSM files into 1 or more larger files. The new compacted files need to added to the max generation in the set.  We need to find that max generation as well as the max sequence number to ensure we write to the next unique location. For each TSM file, create a TSM reader This would be a bug if this occurred as tsmFiles passed in should only be assigned to one compaction at any one time.  A nil tr would mean the file doesn't exist. inform that we're done with this reader when this method returns. CompactFull writes multiple smaller TSM files into 1 or more larger files. CompactFast writes multiple smaller TSM files into 1 or more larger files. removeTmpFiles is responsible for cleaning up a compaction that was started, but then abandoned before the temporary files were dealt with. writeNewFiles writes from the iterator into new TSM files, rotating to a new file once it has reached the max TSM file size. These are the new TSM files written New TSM files are written to a temp file and renamed when fully completed. Write as much as possible to this file We've hit the max file limit and there is more to write.  Create a new file and continue. If the file only contained tombstoned entries, then it would be a 0 length file that we can drop. Don't clean up the file as another compaction is using it.  This should not happen as the planner keeps track of which files are assigned to compaction plans now. Remove any tmp files we already completed We hit an error and didn't finish the compaction.  Remove the temp file and abort. syncingWriter ensures that whatever we wrap the above file descriptor in it will always be able to be synced by the tsm writer, since it does type assertions to attempt to sync. Create the write for the new TSM file. Use a disk based TSM buffer if it looks like we might create a big index in memory. Check for errors where we should not remove the file Each call to read returns the next sorted key (or the prior one if there are more values to write).  The size of values will be less than or equal to our chunk size (1000) Write the key and value If we have a max file size configured and we're over it, close out the file and return the error. Were there any errors encountered during iteration? We're all done.  Close out the file. KeyIterator allows iteration over set of keys and values in sorted order. Next returns true if there are any values remaining in the iterator. Read returns the key, time range, and raw data for the next block, or any error that occurred. Close closes the iterator. Err returns any errors encountered during iteration. EstimatedIndexSize returns the estimated size of the index that would be required to store all the series and entries in the KeyIterator. tsmKeyIterator implements the KeyIterator for set of TSMReaders.  Iteration produces keys in sorted order and the values between the keys sorted and deduped.  If any of the readers have associated tombstone entries, they are returned as part of iteration. readers is the set of readers it produce a sorted key run with values is the temporary buffers for each key that is returned by a reader pos is the current key position within the corresponding readers slice.  A value of pos[0] = 1, means the reader[0] is currently at key 1 in its ordered index. TSMError wraps any error we received while iterating values. indicates whether the iterator should choose a faster merging strategy over a more optimally compressed one.  If fast is true, multiple blocks will just be added as is and not combined.  In some cases, a slower path will need to be utilized even when fast is true to prevent overlapping blocks of time for the same key. If false, the blocks will be decoded and duplicated (if needed) and then chunked into the maximally sized blocks. size is the maximum number of values to encode in a single block key is the current key lowest key across all readers that has not be fully exhausted of values. mergeValues are decoded blocks that have been combined merged are encoded blocks that have been combined or used as is without decode readMin, readMax are the timestamps range of values have been read and encoded from this block. If readMin and readMax are still the initial values, nothing has been read. NewTSMKeyIterator returns a new TSM key iterator from readers. size indicates the maximum number of values to encode in a single block. Any merged blocks pending? Any merged values pending? If we still have blocks from the last read, merge them Read the next block from each TSM iterator This block may have ranges of time removed from it that would reduce the block min and max time. Each reader could have a different key that it's currently at, need to find the next smallest one to keep the sort ordering. block could be nil if the iterator has been exhausted for that file Now we need to find all blocks that match the min key so we can combine and dedupe the blocks if necessary After merging all the values for this key, we might not have any.  (e.g. they were all deleted through many tombstones).  In this case, move on to the next key instead of ending iteration. See if compactions were disabled while we were running. Error returns any errors encountered during iteration. tsmBatchKeyIterator implements the KeyIterator for set of TSMReaders.  Iteration produces errs is any error we received while iterating values. tsmFiles are the string names of the files for use in tracking errors, ordered the same as iterators and buf currentTsm is the current TSM file being iterated over NewTSMBatchKeyIterator returns a new TSM key iterator from readers. NewCacheKeyIterator returns a new KeyIterator from a Cache.

Statistics gathered by the engine. Engine represents a storage engine with compressed blocks. The following group of fields is used to track the state of level compactions within the Engine. The WaitGroup is used to monitor the compaction goroutines, the 'done' channel is used to signal those goroutines to shutdown. Every request to disable level compactions will call 'Wait' on 'wg', with the first goroutine to arrive (levelWorkers == 0 while holding the lock) will close the done channel and re-assign 'nil' to the variable. Re-enabling will decrease 'levelWorkers', and when it decreases to zero, level compactions will be started back up again. waitgroup for active level compaction goroutines channel to signal level compactions to stop Number of "workers" that expect compactions to be in a disabled state channel to signal snapshot compactions to stop waitgroup for running snapshot compactions Logger to be used for important messages Logger to be used when trace-logging is on. CacheFlushMemorySizeThreshold specifies the minimum size threshold for the cache when the engine should write a snapshot to a TSM file CacheFlushWriteColdDuration specifies the length of time after which if no writes have been committed to the WAL, the engine will write a snapshot of the cache to a TSM file WALEnabled determines whether writes to the WAL are enabled.  If this is false, writes will only exist in the cache and can be lost if a snapshot has not occurred. Invoked when creating a backup file "as new". Controls whether to enabled compactions when the engine is open Limiter for concurrent compactions. provides access to the total set of series IDs seriesTypeMap maps a series key to field type muDigest ensures only one goroutine can generate a digest at a time. NewEngine returns a new instance of Engine. Feature flag to enable per-series type checking, by default this is off and e.seriesTypeMap will be nil. Digest returns a reader for the shard's digest. Get a list of tsm file paths from the FileStore. See if there's a fresh digest cached on disk. Return the cached digest. Either no digest existed or the existing one was stale so generate a new digest. Make sure the directory exists, in case it was deleted for some reason. Create a tmp file to write the digest to. Write the new digest to the tmp file. Rename the temporary digest file to the actual digest file. Create and return a reader for the new digest file. SetEnabled sets whether the engine is enabled. SetCompactionsEnabled enables compactions on the engine.  When disabled all running compactions are aborted and new compactions stop running. enableLevelCompactions will request that level compactions start back up again 'wait' signifies that a corresponding call to disableLevelCompactions(true) was made at some point, and the associated task that required disabled compactions is now complete If we don't need to wait, see if we're already enabled still waiting on more workers or already enabled last one to enable, start things back up disableLevelCompactions will stop level compactions before returning. If 'wait' is set to true, then a corresponding call to enableLevelCompactions(true) will be required before level compactions will start back up again. Hold onto the current done channel so we can wait on it if necessary It's possible we have closed the done channel and released the lock and another goroutine has attempted to disable compactions.  We're current in the process of disabling them so check for this and wait until the original completes. Prevent new compactions from starting Stop all background compaction goroutines Signal that all goroutines have exited. Compaction were already disabled. We were not the first caller to disable compactions and they were in the process of being disabled.  Wait for them to complete before returning. Check if already enabled under read lock Check again under write lock We may be in the process of stopping snapshots.  See if the channel was closed. first one here, disable and wait for completion Wait for the snapshot goroutine to exit. Signal that the goroutines are exit and everything is stopped by setting snapDone to nil. If the cache is empty, free up its resources as well. ScheduleFullCompaction will force the engine to fully compact all data stored. This will cancel and running compactions and snapshot any data in the cache to TSM files.  This is an expensive operation. Snapshot any data in the cache Cancel running compactions Ensure compactions are restarted Force the planner to only create a full plan. Path returns the path the engine was opened with. MeasurementFieldSet returns the measurement field set. MeasurementFields returns the measurement fields for a measurement. SeriesN returns the unique number of series in the index. MeasurementsSketches returns sketches that describe the cardinality of the measurements in this shard and measurements that were in this shard, but have been tombstoned. SeriesSketches returns sketches that describe the cardinality of the series in this shard and series that were in this shard, but have LastModified returns the time when this shard was last modified.

Open opens and initializes the engine. TODO(edd): plumb context Close closes the engine. Subsequent calls to Close are a nop. Lock now and close everything else down. Ensures that the channel will not be closed again. WithLogger sets the logger for the engine. LoadMetadataIndex loads the shard metadata into memory. Note, it not safe to call LoadMetadataIndex concurrently. LoadMetadataIndex should only be called when initialising a new Engine. Save reference to index for iterator creation. If we have the cached fields index on disk and we're using TSI, we can skip scanning all the TSM files. Send batch of keys to the index. Reset buffers. Add remaining partial batch from FileStore. load metadata from the Cache Save the field set index so we don't have to rebuild it next time IsIdle returns true if the cache is empty, there are no running compactions and the shard is fully compacted. Free releases any resources held by the engine to free up memory or CPU. Backup writes a tar archive of any TSM files modified since the passed in time to the passed in writer. The basePath will be prepended to the names of the files in the archive. It will force a snapshot of the WAL first then perform the backup with a read lock against the file store. This means that new TSM files will not be able to be created in this shard while the backup is running. For shards that are still acively getting writes, this could cause the WAL to backup, increasing memory usage and evenutally rejecting writes. Remove the temporary snapshot dir Grab the tombstone file if one exists. We overlap time ranges, we need to filter the file overlap to the right overlap to the left TSM file has a range LARGER than the boundary above is the only case where we need to keep the reader open. the TSM file is 100% inside the range, so we can just write it without scanning each block implicit else: here we iterate over the blocks and only keep the ones we really want. not concerned with typ or checksum since we are just blindly writing back, with no decoding make sure the whole file is out to disk Restore reads a tar archive generated by Backup(). Only files that match basePath will be copied into the directory. This obtains a write lock so no operations can be performed while restoring. Import reads a tar archive generated by Backup() and adds each file matching basePath as a new TSM file.  This obtains a write lock so no operations can be performed while Importing. If the import is successful, a full compaction is scheduled. overlay reads a tar archive generated by Backup() and adds each file from the archive matching basePath to the shard. If asNew is true, each file will be installed as a new TSM file even if an existing file with the same name in the backup exists. Copy files from archive while under lock to prevent reopening. The filestore will only handle tsm files. Other file types will be ignored. Load any new series keys to the index If asNew is true, the files created from readFileFromBackup will be new ones having a temp extension. This isn't a .tsm file. Merge and dedup all the series keys across each reader to reduce lock contention on the index. Add remaining partial batch. readFileFromBackup copies the next file from the archive into the shard. The file is skipped if it does not have a matching shardRelativePath prefix. addToIndexFromKey will pull the measurement names, series keys, and field names from composite keys, and add them to the database index and measurement fields. Replace tsm key format with index key format. Build in-memory index, if necessary. WritePoints writes metadata and point data into the engine. It returns an error if new points are added to an existing key. Skip fields name "time", they are illegal Fast-path check to see if the field for the series already exists. Field type is unknown, we can try to add it. Existing type is different from what was passed in, we need to drop this write and refresh the series type map. Doesn't exist, so try to insert We didn't insert and the type that exists isn't what we tried to insert, so we have a conflict and must drop this field/series. The series already exists, but with a different type.  This is also a type conflict and we need to drop this field/series. first try to write to the cache DeleteSeriesRange removes the values between min and max (inclusive) from all series DeleteSeriesRangeWithPredicate removes the values between min and max (inclusive) from all series for which predicate() returns true. If predicate() is nil, then all values in range are removed. Ensure that the index does not compact away the measurement or series we're going to delete before we're done with them. Indicator that the min/max time for the current batch has changed and we need to flush the current batch before appending to it. These are reversed from min/max to ensure they are different the first time through. There is no predicate, so setup newMin/newMax to delete the full time range. See if the series should be deleted and if so, what range of time. If the min/max happens to change for the batch, we need to flush the current batch and start a new one. Disable and abort running compactions so that tombstones added existing tsm files don't get removed.  This would cause deleted measurements/series to re-appear once the compaction completed.  We only disable the level compactions so that snapshotting does not stop while writing out tombstones.  If it is stopped, and writing tombstones takes a long time, writes can get rejected due to the cache filling up. Delete all matching batch. Use the new min/max time for the next iteration deleteSeriesRange removes the values between min and max (inclusive) from all series.  This does not update the index or disable compactions.  This should mainly be called by DeleteSeriesRange and not directly. Min and max time in the engine are slightly different from the query language values. Ensure keys are sorted since lower layers require them to be. Run the delete on each TSM file in parallel See if this TSM file contains the keys and time range Delete each key we find in the file.  We seek to the min key and walk from there. find the keys in the cache and remove them ApplySerialEntryFn cannot return an error in this invocation. Cache does not walk keys in sorted order, so search the sorted series we need to delete to see if any of the cache keys match. k is the measurement + tags + sep + field Sort the series keys because ApplyEntryFn iterates over the keys randomly. delete from the WAL The series are deleted on disk, but the index may still say they exist. Depending on the the min,max time passed in, the series may or not actually exists now.  To reconcile the index, we walk the series keys that still exists on disk and cross out any keys that match the passed in series.  Any series left in the slice at the end do not exist and can be deleted from the index. Note: this is inherently racy if writes are occurring to the same measurement/series are being removed.  A write could occur and exist in the cache at this point, but we would delete it from the index. Apply runs this func concurrently.  The seriesKeys slice is mutated concurrently by different goroutines setting positions to nil. Start from the min deleted key that exists in this file. Skip over any deleted keys that are less than our tsm key We've found a matching key, cross it out so we do not remove it from the index. The seriesKeys slice is mutated if they are still found in the cache. Already crossed out Have we deleted all values for the series? If so, we need to remove the series from the index. For use when accessing series file. This key was wiped because it shouldn't be removed from index. See if this series was found in the cache earlier If there are multiple fields, they will have the same prefix.  If any field has values, then we can't delete it from the index. Remove the series from the local index. Add the id to the set of delete ids. Remove any series IDs for our set that still exist in other shards. We cannot remove these from the series file yet. Remove the remaining ids from the series file as they no longer exist in any shard. In the case of the inmem index the series can be removed across the global index (all shards). A sentinel error message to cause DeleteWithLock to not delete the measurement Under write lock, delete the measurement if we no longer have any data stored for the measurement.  If data exists, we can't delete the field set yet as there were writes to the measurement while we are deleting it. First scan the cache to see if any series exists for this measurement. Check the filestore. Something else failed, return it DeleteMeasurement deletes a measurement and all related series. Attempt to find the series keys. ForEachMeasurementName iterates over each measurement name in the engine. WriteTo is not implemented. WriteSnapshot will snapshot the cache and write a new TSM file with its contents, releasing the snapshot when done. Lock and grab the cache snapshot along with all the closed WAL filenames associated with the snapshot The snapshotted cache may have duplicate points and unsorted data.  We need to deduplicate it before writing the snapshot.  This can be very expensive so it's done while we are not holding the engine write lock. CreateSnapshot will create a temp directory that holds temporary hardlinks to the underylyng shard files. Generate a snapshot of the index. writeSnapshotAndCommit will write the passed cache to a new TSM file and remove the closed WAL segments. write the new snapshot files update the file store with these new files Remove the new snapshot files. We will try again. clear the snapshot from the in-memory cache, then the old WAL files compactCache continually checks if the WAL cache should be written to disk. ShouldCompactCache returns true if the Cache is over its flush threshold or if the passed in lastWriteTime is older than the write cold threshold. Find our compaction plans If no full compactions are need, see if an optimize is needed Update the level plan queue stats Set the queue depths on the scheduler Find the next compaction that can run and try to kick it off Release all the plans we didn't start. compactHiPriorityLevel kicks off compactions using the high priority policy. It returns true if the compaction was started Try hi priority limiter, otherwise steal a little from the low priority if we can. Release the files in the compaction plan Return the unused plans compactLoPriorityLevel kicks off compactions using the lo priority policy. It returns the plans that were not able to be started Try the lo priority limiter, otherwise steal a little from the high priority if we can. compactFull kicks off full and optimize compactions using the lo priority policy. It returns the plans that were not able to be started. compactionStrategy holds the details of what to do in a compaction. Apply concurrently compacts all the groups in a compaction strategy. compactGroup executes the compaction strategy against a single CompactionGroup. We hit a bad TSM file - rename so the next compaction can proceed. levelCompactionStrategy returns a compactionStrategy for the given level. It returns nil if there are no TSM files to compact. fullCompactionStrategy returns a compactionStrategy for higher level generations of TSM files. reloadCache reads the WAL segment files and loads them into the cache. Disable the max size during loading cleanup removes all temp files and dirs that exist on disk.  This is should only be run at startup to avoid removing tmp files that are still in use. Check to see if there are any `.tmp` directories that were left over from failed shard snapshots KeyCursor returns a KeyCursor for the given key starting at time t. CreateIterator returns an iterator for the measurement based on opt. Determine tagsets for this measurement based on dimensions and filters. Reverse the tag sets if we are ordering by descending. Calculate tag sets and apply SLIMIT/SOFFSET. Abort if the query was killed Wrap each series in a call iterator. createVarRefIterator creates an iterator for a variable reference. If we have a LIMIT or OFFSET and the grouping of the outer query is different than the current grouping, we need to perform the limit on each of the individual series keys instead to improve performance. Apply a limit on the merged iterator. When the final dimensions and the current grouping are the same, we will only produce one series so we can use the faster limit iterator. When the dimensions are different than the current grouping, we need to account for the possibility there will be multiple series. The limit iterator in the influxql package handles that scenario. createTagSetIterators creates a set of iterators for a tagset. Set parallelism by number of logical cpus. Create series key groupings w/ return error. Group series keys. Read series groups in parallel. Determine total number of iterators so we can allocate only once. Combine all iterators together and check for errors. If an error occurred, make sure we close all created iterators. createTagSetGroupIterators creates a set of iterators for a subset of a tagset's series. Retrieve non-time fields from this series filter and filter out tags. Enforce series limit at creation time. createVarRefSeriesIterator creates an iterator for a variable reference for a series. Create options specific for this series. Build main cursor. If the field doesn't exist then don't build an iterator. Build auxiliary cursors. Tag values should be returned if the field doesn't exist. Create cursor from field if a tag wasn't requested. If a field was requested, use a nil cursor of the requested type. If field doesn't exist, use the tag value. However, if the tag value is blank then return a null. Remove _tagKey condition field. We can't seach on it because we can't join it to _tagValue based on time. Remove _tagKey conditional references from iterator. Build conditional field cursors. If a conditional field doesn't exist then ignore the series. Limit tags to only the dimensions selected. If it's only auxiliary fields then it doesn't matter what type of iterator we use. Remove name if requested. buildCursor creates an untyped cursor for a field. Check if this is a system field cursor. Check for system field for field keys. Check if we need to perform a cast. Performing a cast in the engine (if it is possible) is much more efficient than an automatic cast. Populate map with tag values. Match against each specific tag. IteratorCost produces the cost of an iterator. Determine if this measurement exists. If it does not, then no shards are accessed to begin with. Determine all of the tag sets for this query. Attempt to retrieve the ref from the main expression (if it exists). Count the number of series concatenated from the tag set. Retrieve the cost for the main expression (if it exists). Retrieve the cost for every auxiliary field since these are also iterators that we may have to look through. We may want to separate these though as we are unlikely to incur anywhere close to the full costs of the auxiliary iterators because many of the selected values are usually skipped. Retrieve the expression names in the condition (if there is a condition). We will also create cursors for these too. Type returns FieldType for a series.  If the series does not exist, ErrUnknownFieldType is returned. Retrieve the range of values within the cache. SeriesFieldKey combine a series key and field name for a unique string to be hashed to a numeric ID. SeriesAndFieldFromCompositeKey returns the series key and the field key extracted from the composite key.

Remove any tombstones If there are no values in this first block (all tombstoned or previously read) and we have more potential blocks too search.  Try again. Only one block with this key and time range so return it Use the current block time range as our overlapping window Blocks are ordered by generation, we may have values in the past in later blocks, if so, expand the window to include the min time range to ensure values are returned in ascending order Find first block that overlaps our window Shrink our window so it's the intersection of the first overlapping block and the first block.  We do this to minimize the region that overlaps and needs to be merged. Search the remaining blocks that overlap our window and append their values so we can merge them.

The extension used to describe corrupt snapshot files. TSMFile represents an on-disk TSM file. Path returns the underlying file path for the TSMFile.  If the file has not be written or loaded from disk, the zero value is returned. Read returns all the values in the block where time t resides. ReadAt returns all the values in the block identified by entry. Entries returns the index entries for all blocks for the given key. Returns true if the TSMFile may contain a value with the specified key and time. Contains returns true if the file contains any values for the given key. OverlapsTimeRange returns true if the time range of the file intersect min and max. OverlapsKeyRange returns true if the key range of the file intersects min and max. TimeRange returns the min and max time across all keys in the file. TombstoneRange returns ranges of time that are deleted for the given key. KeyRange returns the min and max keys in the file. KeyCount returns the number of distinct keys in the file. Seek returns the position in the index with the key <= key. KeyAt returns the key located at index position idx. Type returns the block type of the values stored for the key.  Returns one of BlockFloat64, BlockInt64, BlockBoolean, BlockString.  If key does not exist, an error is returned. BatchDelete return a BatchDeleter that allows for multiple deletes in batches and group commit or rollback. Delete removes the keys from the set of keys available in this file. DeleteRange removes the values for keys between timestamps min and max. HasTombstones returns true if file contains values that have been deleted. TombstoneFiles returns the tombstone filestats if there are any tombstones written for this file. Close closes the underlying file resources. Size returns the size of the file on disk in bytes. Rename renames the existing TSM file to a new name and replaces the mmap backing slice using the new file name.  Index and Reader state are not re-initialized. Remove deletes the file from the filesystem. InUse returns true if the file is currently in use by queries. Ref records that this file is actively in use. Unref records that this file is no longer in use. Stats returns summary information about the TSM file. BlockIterator returns an iterator pointing to the first block in the file and allows sequential iteration to each and every block. Free releases any resources held by the FileStore to free up system resources. Statistics gathered by the FileStore. FileStore is an abstraction around multiple TSM files. Most recently known file stats. If nil then stats will need to be recalculated If true then the kernel will be advised MMAP_WILLNEED for TSM files. limit the number of concurrent opening TSM files. FileStat holds information about a TSM file on disk. OverlapsKeyRange returns true if the min and max keys of the file overlap the arguments min and max. ContainsKey returns true if the min and max keys of the file overlap the arguments min and max. NewFileStore returns a new instance of FileStore based on the given directory. WithObserver sets the observer for the file store. enableTraceLogging must be called before the FileStore is opened. WithLogger sets the logger on the file store. FileStoreStatistics keeps statistics about the file store. Count returns the number of TSM files currently loaded. Files returns the slice of TSM files currently loaded. This is only used for tests, and the files aren't guaranteed to stay valid in the presence of compactions. Free releases any resources held by the FileStore.  The resources will be re-acquired if necessary if they are needed after freeing them. CurrentGeneration returns the current generation of the TSM files. NextGeneration increments the max file ID and returns the new value. WalkKeys calls fn for every key in every TSM file known to the FileStore.  If the key exists in multiple files, it will be invoked for each file. Ensure files are not unmapped while we're iterating over them. Keys returns all keys and types for all files in the file store. Type returns the type of values store at the block for key. Limit apply fn to number of cores DeleteRange removes the values for keys between timestamps min and max.  This should only be used with smaller batches of series keys. Rollback the deletes Open loads all the TSM files in the configured directory. Not loading files from disk so nothing to do find the current max ID for temp directories ascertain the current temp directory number by examining the existing directories and choosing the one with the higest basename when converted to an integer. i must be a valid integer and greater than f.currentTempDirID at this point struct to hold the result of opening each reader in a goroutine Keep track of the latest ID Ensure a limited number of TSM files are loaded at once. Systems which have very large datasets (1TB+) can have thousands of TSM files which can cause extremely long load times. If we are unable to read a TSM file then log the error, rename the file, and continue loading the shard without it. Accumulate file store size stats Re-initialize the lastModified time for the file store Close closes the file store. Make the object appear closed to other method calls. Let other methods access this closed object while we do the actual closing. Read returns the slice of values for the given key and the given timestamp, if any file matches those constraints. Can this file possibly contain this key and timestamp? May have the key and time we are looking for so try to find Reader returns a TSMReader for path if one is currently managed by the FileStore. Otherwise it returns nil. If it returns a file, you must call Unref on it when you are done, and never use it after that. KeyCursor returns a KeyCursor for key and t across the files in the FileStore. Stats returns the stats of the underlying files, preferring the cached version if it is still valid. The file stats cache is invalid due to changes to files. Need to recalculate. If lastFileStats's capacity is far away from the number of entries we need to add, then we'll reallocate. ReplaceWithCallback replaces oldFiles with newFiles and calls updatedFn with the files to be added the FileStore. Replace replaces oldFiles with newFiles. Rename all the new files to make them live on restart This isn't a .tsm or .tsm.tmp file. give the observer a chance to process the file first. The new TSM files have a tmp extension.  First rename them. Any error after this point should result in the file being bein named back to the original name. The caller then has the opportunity to remove it. Keep track of the new mod time Copy the current set of active files while we rename and load the new files.  We copy the pointers here to minimize the time that locks are held as well as to ensure that the replacement is atomic.© We need to prune our set of active files now If queries are running against this file, then we need to move it out of the way and let them complete.  We'll then delete the original file to avoid blocking callers upstream.  If the process crashes, the temp file is cleaned up at startup automatically. In order to ensure that there are no races with this (file held externally calls Ref after we check InUse), we need to maintain the invariant that every handle to a file is handed out in use (Ref'd), and handlers only ever relinquish the file once (call Unref exactly once, and never use it again). InUse is only valid during a write lock, since we allow calls to Ref and Unref under the read lock and no lock at all respectively. Copy all the tombstones related to this TSM file Rename the TSM file used by this reader Remove the old file and tombstones.  We can't use the normal TSMReader.Remove() because it now refers to our temp file which we can't remove. Tell the purger about our in-use files we need to remove If times didn't change (which can happen since file mod times are second level), then add a ns to the time to ensure that lastModified changes since files on disk actually did change Recalculate the disk size stat LastModified returns the last time the file store was updated with new TSM files or a delete. BlockCount returns number of values stored in the block at location idx in the file at path.  If path does not match any file in the store, 0 is returned.  If idx is out of range for the number of blocks in the file, 0 is returned. on Error, BlockCount(block) returns 0 for cnt We need to determine the possible files that may be accessed by this query given Skip any blocks only contain values that are tombstoned. locations returns the files and index blocks for a key and time.  ascending indicates whether the key will be scan in ascending time order or descenging time order. This function assumes the read-lock has been taken. If we ascending and the max time of the file is before where we want to start skip it. If we are descending and the min time of the file is after where we want to start, then skip it. This file could potential contain points we are looking for so find the blocks for the given key. If we ascending and the max time of a block is before where we are looking, skip it since the data is out of our range If we descending and the min time of a block is after where we are looking, skip For an ascending cursor, mark everything before the seek time as read so we can filter it out at query time For an ascending cursort, mark everything after the seek time as read Otherwise, add this file and block location CreateSnapshot creates hardlinks for all tsm and tombstone files in the path provided. create a copy of the files slice and ensure they aren't closed out from under us, nor the slice mutated. increment and keep track of the current temp dir for when we drop the lock. this ensures we are the only writer to the directory. create the tmp directory and add the hard links. there is no longer any shared mutable state. FormatFileNameFunc is executed when generating a new TSM filename. Source filenames are provided via src. DefaultFormatFileName is the default implementation to format TSM filenames. ParseFileNameFunc is executed when parsing a TSM filename into generation & sequence. DefaultParseFileName is used to parse the filenames of TSM files. KeyCursor allows iteration through keys in a set of files within a FileStore. seeks is all the file locations that we need to return during iteration. current is the set of blocks possibly containing the next set of points. Normally this is just one entry, but there may be multiple if points have been overwritten. pos is the index within seeks.  Based on ascending, it will increment or decrement through the size of seeks slice. newKeyCursor returns a new instance of KeyCursor. Determine the distinct set of TSM files in use and mark then as in-use Close removes all references on the cursor. Remove all of our in-use references since we're done seek positions the cursor at the given time. Record the position of the first block matching our seek time Next moves the cursor to the next position. Data should be read by the ReadBlock functions.

This code is originally from: https://github.com/dgryski/go-tsz and has been modified to remove
the timestamp compression functionality.

It implements the float compression as presented in: http://www.vldb.org/pvldb/vol8/p1816-teller.pdf.
This implementation uses a sentinel value of NaN which means that float64 NaN cannot be stored using
this version.
 Note: an uncompressed format is not yet implemented. floatCompressedGorilla is a compressed format using the gorilla paper encoding uvnan is the constant returned from math.NaN(). FloatEncoder encodes multiple float64s into a byte slice. NewFloatEncoder returns a new FloatEncoder. Reset sets the encoder back to its initial state. Bytes returns a copy of the underlying byte buffer used in the encoder. Flush indicates there are no more values to encode. write an end-of-stream record Write encodes v to the underlying buffer. Only allow NaN as a sentinel value first point TODO(dgryski): check if it's 'cheaper' to reset the leading/trailing bits instead FloatDecoder decodes a byte slice into multiple float64 values. SetBytes initializes the decoder with b. Must call before calling Next(). first byte is the compression type. we currently just have gorilla compression. Reset all fields. Next returns true if there are remaining values to read. mark as finished if there were no values. IsNaN read compressed value it.val = it.val reuse leading/trailing zero bits it.leading, it.trailing = it.leading, it.trailing 0 significant bits here means we overflowed and we actually need 64; see comment in encoder Values returns the current float64 value. Error returns the current decoding error./Users/austinjaybecker/projects/abeck-go-testing/tsdb/engine/tsm1/int.gogithub.com/jwilder/encoding/simple8b"github.com/jwilder/encoding/simple8b"IntegerDecoder: not enough data to decode RLE starting value"IntegerDecoder: not enough data to decode RLE starting value"IntegerDecoder: invalid RLE delta value"IntegerDecoder: invalid RLE delta value"IntegerDecoder: invalid RLE repeat value"IntegerDecoder: invalid RLE repeat value"IntegerDecoder: not enough data to decode packed value"IntegerDecoder: not enough data to decode packed value"failed to decode value %v: %v"failed to decode value %v: %v"IntegerDecoder: not enough data to decode uncompressed value"IntegerDecoder: not enough data to decode uncompressed value" Integer encoding uses two different strategies depending on the range of values in the uncompressed data.  Encoded values are first encoding used zig zag encoding. This interleaves positive and negative integers across a range of positive integers. For example, [-2,-1,0,1] becomes [3,1,0,2]. See https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/encoding?hl=en#signed-integers for more information. If all the zig zag encoded values are less than 1 << 60 - 1, they are compressed using simple8b encoding.  If any value is larger than 1 << 60 - 1, the values are stored uncompressed. Each encoded byte slice contains a 1 byte header followed by multiple 8 byte packed integers or 8 byte uncompressed integers.  The 4 high bits of the first byte indicate the encoding type for the remaining bytes. There are currently two encoding types that can be used with room for 16 total.  These additional encoding slots are reserved for future use.  One improvement to be made is to use a patched encoding such as PFOR if only a small number of values exceed the max compressed value range.  This should improve compression ratios with very large integers near the ends of the int64 range. intUncompressed is an uncompressed format using 8 bytes per point intCompressedSimple is a bit-packed format using simple8b encoding intCompressedRLE is a run-length encoding format IntegerEncoder encodes int64s into byte slices. NewIntegerEncoder returns a new integer encoder with an initial buffer of values sized at sz. Write encodes v to the underlying buffers. Delta-encode each value as it's written.  This happens before ZigZagEncoding because the deltas could be negative. Bytes returns a copy of the underlying buffer. Only run-length encode if it could reduce storage size. Value is too large to encode using packed format Encode all but the first value.  Fist value is written unencoded using 8 bytes. IntegerDecoder decodes a byte slice into int64s. 240 is the maximum number of values that can be encoded into a single uint64 using simple8b The first value for a run-length encoded byte slice The delta value for a run-length encoded byte slice SetBytes sets the underlying byte slice of the decoder. Next returns true if there are any values remaining to be decoded. Error returns the last error encountered by the decoder. Read returns the next value from the decoder. v is the delta encoded value, we need to add the prior value to get the original Store the first value and delta value so we do not need to allocate a large values slice.  We can compute the value at position d.i on demand. We've process all the bytes The first value is always unencoded Should never happen, only error that could be returned is if the the value to be decoded was not actually encoded by simple8b encoder./Users/austinjaybecker/projects/abeck-go-testing/tsdb/engine/tsm1/iterator.gen.gocvaluetvalueFloatIterator finalized by GC"FloatIterator finalized by GC"unexpected metrics"unexpected metrics"IntegerIterator finalized by GC"IntegerIterator finalized by GC"UnsignedIterator finalized by GC"UnsignedIterator finalized by GC"StringIterator finalized by GC"StringIterator finalized by GC"BooleanIterator finalized by GC"BooleanIterator finalized by GC" cursorAt provides a bufferred cursor interface. This required for literal value cursors which don't have a time value. bufCursor implements a bufferred cursor. newBufCursor returns a bufferred wrapper for cur. next returns the buffer, if filled. Otherwise returns the next key/value from the cursor. unread pushes k and v onto the buffer. peek reads next next key/value without removing them from the cursor. nextAt returns the next value where key is equal to seek. Skips over any keys that are less than seek. If the key doesn't exist then a nil value is returned instead. Return "nil" value for type. statsBufferCopyIntervalN is the number of points that are read before copying the stats buffer to the iterator's stats field. This is used to amortize the cost of using a mutex when updating stats. map used for condition evaluation reusable buffer Read from the main cursor if we have one. Otherwise find lowest aux timestamp. Exit if we have no more points or we are outside our time range. Read from each auxiliary cursor. Read from condition field cursors.

UnmarshalPredicate takes stored predicate bytes from a Marshal call and returns a Predicate. Design Predicates lazily evaluate with memoization so that we can walk a series key by the tags without parsing them into a structure and allocating. Each node in a predicate tree keeps a cache if it has enough information to have a definite value. The predicate state keeps track of all of the tag key/value pairs passed to it, and has a reset function to start over for a new series key. For example, imagine a query like	("tag1" == "val1" AND "tag2" == "val2") OR "tag3" == "val3" The state would have tag values set on it like	state.Set("tag1", "val1")        => NeedMore	state.Set("tag2", "not-val2")    => NeedMore	state.Set("tag3", "val3")        => True where after the first Set, the AND and OR clauses are both NeedMore, after the second Set, the AND clause is False and the OR clause is NeedMore, and after the last Set, the AND clause is still False, and the OR clause is True. Fast resetting is achieved by having each cache maintain a pointer to the state and both having a generation number. When the state resets, it bumps the generation number, and when the value is set in the cache, it is set with the current generation of the state. When querying the cache, it checks if the generation still matches. Protobuf Implementation NewProtobufPredicate returns a Predicate that matches based on the comparison structure described by the incoming protobuf. Walk the predicate to collect the tag refs Only add to the matcher locations the first time we encounter the tag key reference. This prevents problems with redundant predicates like:   foo = a AND foo = b   foo = c AND foo = d Construct the shared state and root predicate node. predicateMatcher implements Predicate for a protobuf. Clone returns a deep copy of p's state and root node. It is not safe to modify p.pred on the returned clone. Matches checks if the key matches the predicate by feeding individual tags into the state and returning as soon as the root node has a definite answer. Extract the series from the composite key Determine which popping algorithm to use. If there are no escape characters we can use the quicker method that only works in that case. Feed tag pairs into the state and update until we have a definite response. If it always needed more then it didn't match. For example, consider if the predicate matches `tag1=val1` but tag1 is not present in the key. Marshal returns a buffer representing the protobuf predicate. Prefix it with the version byte so that we can change in the future if necessary walkPredicateNodes recursively calls the function for each node. buildPredicateNode takes a protobuf node and converts it into a predicateNode. It is strict in what it accepts. Fill in the left side of the comparison Tag refs look up the location of the tag in the state Left literals are only allowed to be strings Fill in the right side of the comparison Right literals are allowed to be regexes as well as strings Ensure that a regex is set on the right if and only if the comparison is a regex Predicate Responses Predicate State predicateState keeps track of tag key=>value mappings with cheap methods to reset to a blank state. newPredicateState creates a predicateState given a map of keys to indexes into an an array. so that caches start out unfilled since they start at 0 Clone returns a deep copy of p. Reset clears any set values for the state. Set sets the key to be the value and returns true if the key is part of the considered set of keys. Predicate Cache predicateCache interacts with the predicateState to keep determined responses memoized until the state has been Reset to avoid recomputing nodes. newPredicateCache constructs a predicateCache for the provided state. Cached returns the cached response and a boolean indicating if it is valid. Store sets the cache to the provided response until the state is Reset. Predicate Nodes predicateNode is the interface that any parts of a predicate tree implement. Update informs the node that the state has been updated and asks it to return a response. Clone returns a deep copy of the node. predicateNodeAnd combines two predicate nodes with an And. Update checks if both of the left and right nodes are true. If either is false then the node is definitely false. Otherwise, it needs more information. predicateNodeOr combines two predicate nodes with an Or. Update checks if either the left and right nodes are true. If both nodes are false, then the node is definitely false. Otherwise, it needs more information. predicateNodeComparison compares values of tags. Update checks if both sides of the comparison are determined, and if so, evaluates the comparison to a determined truth value. predicateEval is a helper to do the appropriate comparison depending on which comparison enumeration value was passed. Popping Tags The models package has some of this logic as well, but doesn't export ways to get at individual tags one at a time. In the common, no escape characters case, popping the first tag off of a series key takes around ~10ns. predicatePopTag pops a tag=value pair from the front of series, returning the remainder in rest. it assumes there are no escaped characters in the series. find the first ',' find the first '=' predicatePopTagEscape pops a tag=value pair from the front of series, returning the remainder in rest. it assumes there are possibly/likely escaped characters in the series. find the first unescaped ',' this is the last tag pair make index relative to full series slice the comma is escaped find the first unescaped '=' there is no tag value the equals is escaped sad time: it's possible this tag/value has escaped characters, so we have to find an unescape them. since the byte slice may refer to read-only memory, we can't do this in place, so we make copies./Users/austinjaybecker/projects/abeck-go-testing/tsdb/engine/tsm1/reader.gen.go Source: reader.gen.go.tmpl ReadFloatBlockAt returns the float values corresponding to the given index entry.

BatchDelete returns a BatchDeleter.  Only a single goroutine may run a BatchDelete at a time. Callers must either Commit or Rollback the operation. indirectIndex is a TSMIndex that uses a raw byte slice representation of an index.  This implementation can be used for indexes that may be MMAPed into memory. indirectIndex works a follows.  Assuming we have an index structure in memory as the diagram below: ┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐ │                               Index                                │ ├─┬──────────────────────┬──┬───────────────────────┬───┬────────────┘ │0│                      │62│                       │145│ ├─┴───────┬─────────┬────┼──┴──────┬─────────┬──────┼───┴─────┬──────┐ │Key 1 Len│   Key   │... │Key 2 Len│  Key 2  │ ...  │  Key 3  │ ...  │ │ 2 bytes │ N bytes │    │ 2 bytes │ N bytes │      │ 2 bytes │      │ └─────────┴─────────┴────┴─────────┴─────────┴──────┴─────────┴──────┘ We would build an `offsets` slices where each element pointers to the byte location for the first key in the index slice. │                              Offsets                               │ ├────┬────┬────┬─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘ │ 0  │ 62 │145 │ └────┴────┴────┘ Using this offset slice we can find `Key 2` by doing a binary search over the offsets slice.  Instead of comparing the value in the offsets (e.g. `62`), we use that as an index into the underlying index to retrieve the key at position `62` and perform our comparisons with that. When we have identified the correct position in the index for a given key, we could perform another binary search or a linear scan.  This should be fast as well since each index entry is 28 bytes and all contiguous in memory.  The current implementation uses a linear scan since the number of block entries is expected to be < 100 per key. b is the underlying index byte slice.  This could be a copy on the heap or an MMAP slice reference offsets contains the positions in b for each key.  It points to the 2 byte length of minKey, maxKey are the minium and maximum (lexicographically sorted) contained in the file minTime, maxTime are the minimum and maximum times contained in the file across all series. tombstones contains only the tombstoned keys with subset of time values deleted.  An entry would exist here if a subset of the points for a key were deleted and the file had not be re-compacted to remove the points on disk. TimeRange holds a min and max timestamp. NewIndirectIndex returns a new indirect index. searchOffset searches the offsets slice for key and returns the position in offsets where key would exist. We use a binary search across our indirect offsets (pointers to all the keys in the index slice). i is the position in offsets we are at so get offset it points to It's pointing to the start of the key which is a 2 byte length See if it matches See if we might have found the right index The key is not in the index.  i is the index where it would be inserted so return a value outside our offset range. search returns the byte position of key in the index.  If key is not in the index, len(index) is returned. TODO(sgc): this should be inlined to `indirectIndex` as it is only used here The search may have returned an i == 0 which could indicated that the value searched should be inserted at position 0.  Make sure the key in the index matches the search value. ContainsKey returns true of key may exist in this index. Read and return all the entries ReadEntries returns all index entries for a key. The key is not in the index.  i is the index where it would be inserted. matches the key an timestamp, nil is returned. Key returns the key in the index at the given position. Both keys and offsets are sorted.  Walk both in order and skip any keys that exist in both. No keys, nothing to do If we're deleting the max time range, just use tombstoning to remove the key from the offsets slice Is the range passed in outside of the time range for the file? Skip any keys that don't exist.  These are less than the current key. No more keys to delete, we're done. If the current key is greater than the index one, continue to the next index key. If multiple tombstones are saved for the same key Is the time range passed outside of the time range we've have stored for this key? Does the range passed in cover every value for the key? Append the new tombonstes to the existing ones Sort the updated tombstones if necessary We need to see if all the tombstones end up deleting the entire series.  This could happen if their is one tombstore with min,max time spanning all the block time ranges or from multiple smaller tombstones the delete segments.  To detect this cases, we use a window starting at the first tombstone and grow it be each tombstone that is immediately adjacent to the current window or if it overlaps. If there are any gaps, we abort. Make sure all the tombstone line up for a continuous range.  We don't want to have two small deletes on each edges end up causing us to remove the full key. If we have a fully deleted series, delete it all of it. Delete all the keys that fully deleted in bulk ContainsValue returns true if key and time might exist in this file. Type returns the block type of the values stored for the key. KeyRange returns the min and max keys in the index. TimeRange returns the min and max time across all keys in the index. MarshalBinary returns a byte slice encoded version of the index. Keep a reference to the actual index bytesvar minKey, maxKey []byte To create our "indirect" index, we need to find the location of all the keys in the raw byte slice.  The keys are listed once each (in sorted order).  Following each key is a time ordered list of index entry blocks for that key.  The loop below basically skips across the slice keeping track of the counter when we are at a key field. Skip to the start of the values key length value (2) + type (1) + length of key count of index entries Find the min time for the block Find the max time for the block Windows doesn't use the anonymous map for the offsets index mmapAccess is mmap based block accessor.  It access blocks through an MMAP file interface. Counter incremented everytime the mmapAccessor is accessed Counter to determine whether the accessor can free its resources If true then mmap advise value MADV_WILLNEED will be provided the kernel for b. Hint to the kernel that we will be reading the file.  It would be better to hint that we will be reading the index section, but that's not been implemented as yet. Allow resources to be freed immediately if requested Already freed everything. Were there accesses after the last time we tried to free? If so, don't free anything and record the access count that we see now for the next check. Reset both counters to zero to indicate that we have freed everything.TODO: Validate checksum return the bytes after the 4 byte checksum readAll returns all values for a key in all blocks.

It basically defines the maximum number of partitions you can have in the ring. If a smaller number of partitions are chosen when creating a ring, then they're evenly spread across this many partitions in the ring. ring is a structure that maps series keys to entries. ring is implemented as a crude hash ring, in so much that you can have variable numbers of members in the ring, and the appropriate member for a given series key can always consistently be found. Unlike a true hash ring though, this ring is not resizeable—there must be at most 256 members in the ring, and the number of members must always be a power of 2. ring works as follows: Each member of the ring contains a single store, which contains a map of series keys to entries. A ring always has 256 partitions, and a member takes up one or more of these partitions (depending on how many members are specified to be in the ring) To determine the partition that a series key should be added to, the series key is hashed and the first 8 bits are used as an index to the ring. Number of keys within the ring. This is used to provide a hint for allocating the return values in keys(). It will not be perfectly accurate since it doesn't consider adding duplicate keys, or trying to remove non- existent keys. The unique set of partitions in the ring. len(partitions) <= len(continuum) newring returns a new ring initialised with n partitions. n must always be a power of 2, and for performance reasons should be larger than the number of cores on the host. The supported set of values for n is:     {1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256}. maximum number of partitions. The trick here is to map N partitions to all points on the continuum, such that the first eight bits of a given hash will map directly to one of the N partitions. reset resets the ring so it can be reused. Before removing references to entries within each partition it gathers sizing information to provide hints when reallocating entries in partition maps. reset is not safe for use by multiple goroutines. getPartition retrieves the hash ring partition associated with the provided entry returns the entry for the given key. entry is safe for use by multiple goroutines. write writes values to the entry in the ring's partition associated with key. If no entry exists for the key then one will be created. write is safe for use by multiple goroutines. add adds an entry to the ring. remove deletes the entry for the given key. remove is safe for use by multiple goroutines. keys returns all the keys from all partitions in the hash ring.

It's safe for use by multiple goroutines. write writes the values to the entry in the partition, creating the entry if it does not exist. Hot path. Check again. Create a new entry using a preallocated size if we have a hint available. add adds a new entry for key to the partition. remove deletes the entry associated with the provided key. keys returns an unsorted slice of the keys in the partition. reset resets the partition by reinitialising the store. reset returns hints about sizes that the entries within the store could be reallocated with./Users/austinjaybecker/projects/abeck-go-testing/tsdb/engine/tsm1/scheduler.golevel1Runninglevel2Runninglevel3Runninglevel4RunningloLimitweighthiLimit0.20.20000000000000001113602879701896397/18014398509481984 queues is the depth of work pending for each compaction level/Users/austinjaybecker/projects/abeck-go-testing/tsdb/engine/tsm1/string.goStringDecoder: invalid encoded string length"StringDecoder: invalid encoded string length"StringDecoder: length overflow"StringDecoder: length overflow"StringDecoder: not enough data to represent encoded string"StringDecoder: not enough data to represent encoded string" String encoding uses snappy compression to compress each string.

It uses a combination of delta encoding, scaling and compression using simple8b, run length encoding as well as falling back to no compression if needed. Timestamp values to be encoded should be sorted before encoding.  When encoded, the values are first delta-encoded.  The first value is the starting timestamp, subsequent values are the difference from the prior value. Timestamp resolution can also be in the nanosecond.  Many timestamps are monotonically increasing and fall on even boundaries of time such as every 10s.  When the timestamps have this structure, they are scaled by the largest common divisor that is also a factor of 10.  This has the effect of converting very large integer deltas into very small one that can be reversed by multiplying them by the scaling factor. Using these adjusted values, if all the deltas are the same, the time range is stored using run length encoding.  If run length encoding is not possible and all values are less than 1 << 60 - 1 (~36.5 yrs in nanosecond resolution), then the timestamps are encoded using simple8b encoding.  If any value exceeds the maximum values, the deltas are stored uncompressed using 8b each. Each compressed byte slice has a 1 byte header indicating the compression type.  The 4 high bits indicate the encoding type.  The 4 low bits are used by the encoding type. For run-length encoding, the 4 low bits store the log10 of the scaling factor.  The next 8 bytes are the starting timestamp, next 1-10 bytes is the delta value using variable-length encoding, finally the next 1-10 bytes is the count of values. For simple8b encoding, the 4 low bits store the log10 of the scaling factor.  The next 8 bytes is the first delta value stored uncompressed, the remaining bytes are 64bit words containing compressed delta For uncompressed encoding, the delta values are stored using 8 bytes each. timeUncompressed is a an uncompressed format using 8 bytes per timestamp timeCompressedPackedSimple is a bit-packed format using simple8b encoding timeCompressedRLE is a run-length encoding format TimeEncoder encodes time.Time to byte slices.

This should be the full path to a TSM file. cache of the stats for this tombstone indicates that the stats may be out of sync with what is on disk and they should be refreshed. Tombstones that have been written but not flushed to disk yet. These are references used for pending writes that have not been committed.  If these are nil, then no pending writes are in progress. Optional observer for when tombstone files are written. NewTombstoner constructs a Tombstoner for the given path. FilterFn can be nil. Tombstone represents an individual deletion. Key is the tombstoned series key. Min and Max are the min and max unix nanosecond time ranges of Key that are deleted.  If the full range is deleted, both values are -1. WithObserver sets a FileStoreObserver for when the tombstone file is written. Add adds the all keys, across all timestamps, to the tombstone. AddRange adds all keys to the tombstone specifying only the data between min and max to be removed. If this TSMFile has not been written (mainly in tests), don't write a tombstone because the keys will not be written when it's actually saved. Reset our temp references and clean up. Delete removes all the tombstone files from disk. TombstoneFiles returns any tombstone files associated with Tombstoner's TSM file. The file doesn't exist so record that we tried to load it so we don't continue to keep trying.  This is the common case. Walk calls fn for every Tombstone under the Tombstoner. Might be a zero length file which should not exist, but an old bug allowed them to occur.  Treat it as an empty v1 tombstone file so we don't abort loading the TSM file.

WriteWALEntryType indicates a write entry. DeleteWALEntryType indicates a delete entry. DeleteRangeWALEntryType indicates a delete range entry. ErrWALClosed is returned when attempting to write to a closed WAL file.

WAL represents the write-ahead log used for writing TSM files. goroutines waiting for the next fsync write variables cache and flush variables syncDelay sets the duration to wait before fsyncing writes.  A value of 0 (default) will cause every write to be fsync'd.  This must be set before the WAL is opened if a non-default value is required. WALOutput is the writer used by the logger. SegmentSize is the file size at which a segment file will be rotated statistics for the WAL NewWAL initializes a new WAL at the given directory. these options should be overridden by any options in the config enableTraceLogging must be called before the WAL is opened. WithLogger sets the WAL's logger. WALStatistics maintains statistics about the WAL. Path returns the directory the log was initialized with. Open opens and initializes the Log. Open can recover from previous unclosed shutdowns. Set the correct size on the segment writer scheduleSync will schedule an fsync to the current wal segment and notify any waiting gorutines.  If an fsync is already scheduled, subsequent calls will not schedule a new fsync and will be handle by the existing scheduled fsync. If we're not the first to sync, then another goroutine is fsyncing the wal for us.

Create a RW chan and close it Convert it to a read-only sync fsyncs the current wal segments and notifies any waiters.  Callers must ensure a write lock on the WAL is obtained before calling sync. WriteMulti writes the given values to the WAL. It returns the WAL segment ID to which the points were written. If an error is returned the segment ID should be ignored. ClosedSegments returns a slice of the names of the closed segment files. Skip the current path Remove deletes the given segment file paths from disk and cleans up any associated objects. Refresh the on-disk size stats LastWriteTime is the last time anything was written to the WAL. limit how many concurrent encodings can be in flight.

Make sure the log has not been closed roll the segment file if needed write and sync Update stats for current segment size schedule an fsync and wait for it to complete rollSegment checks if the current segment is due to roll over to a new segment; and if so, opens a new segment file for future writes. A drop database or RP call could trigger this error if writes were in-flight when the drop statement executes. CloseSegment closes the current segment if it is non-empty and opens a new one. Delete deletes the given keys, returning the segment ID for the operation. DeleteRange deletes the given keys within the given time range, returning the segment ID for the operation. Close will finish any flush that is currently in progress and close file handles. Close, but don't set to nil so future goroutines can still be signaled segmentFileNames will return all files that are WAL segment files in sorted order by ascending ID. newSegmentFile will close the current segment file and open a new one, updating bookkeeping info on the log. Reset the current segment size stat WALEntry is record stored in each WAL segment.  Each entry has a type and an opaque, type dependent byte slice data attribute. WriteWALEntry represents a write of points. Type (1), Key Length (2), and Count (4) for each key determine required length timestamps (8) Encode converts the WriteWALEntry into a byte stream using dst if it is large enough.  If dst is too small, the slice will be grown to fit the encoded entry. The entries values are encode as follows: For each key and slice of values, first a 1 byte type for the []Values slice is written.  Following the type, the length and key bytes are written. Following the key, a 4 byte count followed by each value as a 8 byte time and N byte value.  The value is dependent on the type being encoded.  float64, int64, use 8 bytes, boolean uses 1 byte, and string is similar to the key encoding, except that string values have a 4-byte length, and keys only use 2 bytes. This structure is then repeated for each key an value slices. │                           WriteWALEntry                            │ ├──────┬─────────┬────────┬───────┬─────────┬─────────┬───┬──────┬───┤ │ Type │ Key Len │   Key  │ Count │  Time   │  Value  │...│ Type │...│ │1 byte│ 2 bytes │ N bytes│4 bytes│ 8 bytes │ N bytes │   │1 byte│   │ └──────┴─────────┴────────┴───────┴─────────┴─────────┴───┴──────┴───┘ allocate or re-slice to correct size Finally, encode the entry MarshalBinary returns a binary representation of the entry in a new byte slice.

A TSM file is composed for four sections: header, blocks, index and the footer.

Header is composed of a magic number to identify the file type and a version
number.

Blocks are sequences of pairs of CRC32 and data.  The block data is opaque to the
file.  The CRC32 is used for block level error detection.  The length of the blocks
is stored in the index.

Following the blocks is the index for the blocks in the file.  The index is
composed of a sequence of index entries ordered lexicographically by key and
then by time.  Each index entry starts with a key length and key followed by a
count of the number of blocks in the file.  Each block entry is composed of
the min and max time for the block, the offset into the file where the block
is located and the the size of the block.

The index structure can provide efficient access to all blocks as well as the
ability to determine the cost associated with accessing a given key.  Given a key
and timestamp, we can determine whether a file contains the block for that
timestamp as well as where that block resides and how much data to read to
retrieve the block.  If we know we need to read all or multiple blocks in a
file, we can use the size to determine how much to read in a given IO.

 MagicNumber is written as the first 4 bytes of a data file to identify the file as a tsm1 formatted file Version indicates the version of the TSM file format. Size in bytes of an index entry Size in bytes used to store the count of index entries for a key Size in bytes used to store the type of block encoded Max number of blocks for a given key that can exist in a single file max length of a key in an index entry (measurement + tags) The threshold amount data written before we periodically fsync a TSM file.  This helps avoid long pauses due to very large fsyncs at the end of writing a TSM file.ErrNoValues is returned when TSMWriter.WriteIndex is called and there are no values to write. ErrTSMClosed is returned when performing an operation against a closed TSM file. ErrMaxKeyLengthExceeded is returned when attempting to write a key that is too long. ErrMaxBlocksExceeded is returned when attempting to write a block past the allowed number. TSMWriter writes TSM formatted key and values. Write writes a new block for key containing and values.  Writes append blocks in the order that the Write function is called.  The caller is responsible for ensuring keys and blocks are sorted appropriately. Values are encoded as a full block.  The caller is responsible for ensuring a fixed number of values are encoded in each block as well as ensuring the Values are sorted. The first and last timestamp values are used as the minimum and maximum values for the index entry. WriteBlock writes a new block for key containing the bytes in block.  WriteBlock appends blocks in the order that the WriteBlock function is called.  The caller is responsible for ensuring keys and blocks are sorted appropriately, and that the block and index information is correct for the block.  The minTime and maxTime timestamp values are used as the minimum and maximum values for the index entry. WriteIndex finishes the TSM write streams and writes the index. Flushes flushes all pending changes to the underlying file resources. Close closes any underlying file resources. Size returns the current size in bytes of the file. IndexWriter writes a TSMIndex. Add records a new block entry for a key in the index. Size returns the size of a the current index in bytes. WriteTo writes the index contents to a writer. IndexEntry is the index information for a given block in a TSM file. The min and max time of all points stored in the block. The absolute position in the file where this block is located. The size in bytes of the block in the file. UnmarshalBinary decodes an IndexEntry from a byte slice. AppendTo writes a binary-encoded version of IndexEntry to b, allocating and returning a new slice, if necessary. Contains returns true if this IndexEntry may contain values for the given time. The min and max times are inclusive. OverlapsTimeRange returns true if the given time ranges are completely within the entry's time bounds. String returns a string representation of the entry. NewIndexWriter returns a new IndexWriter. directIndex is a simple in-memory index implementation for a TSM file.  The full index must fit in memory.

The last block is still this key We have a new key that is greater than the last one so we need to add a new index block section. Keys can't be added out of order. copyBuffer is the actual implementation of Copy and CopyBuffer. if buf is nil, one is allocated.  This is copied from the Go stdlib in order to remove the fast path WriteTo calls which circumvent any IO throttling as well as to add periodic fsyncs to avoid long stalls. For each key, individual entries are sorted by time Append the key length and key Append the block type and count Append each index entry for all blocks for this key If this is a disk based index and we've written more than the fsync threshold, fsync the data to avoid long pauses later on. Flush anything remaining in the index Remove removes the index from any temporary storage Close the file handle to prevent leaking.  We ignore the error because we just want to cleanup and remove the file. tsmWriter writes keys and values in the TSM format NewTSMWriter returns a new TSMWriter writing to w. NewTSMWriterWithDiskBuffer returns a new TSMWriter writing to w and will use a disk based buffer for the TSM index if possible. Make sure is a File so we can write the temp index alongside it. w is not a file, just use an inmem index Write writes a new block containing key and values. Nothing to write Write header only after we have some data to write. Record this block in index Increment file position pointer WriteBlock writes block for the given key and time range to the TSM file.  If the write exceeds max entries for a given key, ErrMaxBlocksExceeded is returned.  This indicates that the index is now full for this key and no future writes to this key will succeed. Increment file position pointer (checksum + block len) fsync the file periodically to avoid long pauses with very big files. WriteIndex writes the index section of the file.  If there are no index entries to write, this returns ErrNoValues. Set the destination file on the index so we can periodically fsync while writing the index. Write the index Write the index index position sync is a minimal interface to make sure we can sync the wrapped value. we use a minimal interface to be as robust as possible for syncing these files.

Engine represents a swappable storage engine for the shard. Statistics will return statistics relevant to this engine. SeriesIDSets provides access to the total set of series IDs EngineFormat represents the format for an engine. TSM1Format is the format used by the tsm1 engine. NewEngineFunc creates a new engine. newEngineFuncs is a lookup of engine constructors by name. RegisterEngine registers a storage engine initializer by name.

Create a new engine If it's a dir then it's a tsm1 engine Lookup engine by format. EngineOptions represents the options used to initialize the engine. shared in-memory index Limits the concurrent number of TSM files that can be loaded at once. CompactionDisabled specifies shards should not schedule compactions. This option is intended for offline tooling. DatabaseFilter is a predicate controlling which databases may be opened. If no function is set, all databases will be opened. RetentionPolicyFilter is a predicate controlling which combination of database and retention policy may be opened. nil will allow all combinations to pass. ShardFilter is a predicate controlling which combination of database, retention policy and shard group may be opened. NewEngineOptions constructs an EngineOptions object with safe default values. This should only be used in tests; production environments should read from a config file. NewInmemIndex returns a new "inmem" index type. FileStoreObserver is passed notifications before the file store adds or deletes files.

Done signals to anyone waiting on the guard that they can proceed. exprGuard is a union of influxql.Expr based guards. a nil exprGuard matches everything, while the zero value matches nothing. empty returns true if the exprGuard is empty, meaning that it matches no points. newExprGuard scrutinizes the expression and returns an efficient guard. matches everything matches nothing reduce short circuit if we couldn't analyze, match everything newBinaryExprGuard scrutinizes the binary expression and returns an efficient guard. if it's a nested binary expression, always match. ensure one of the expressions is a VarRef, and make that the key. check the key for situations we know we can't filter. scrutinize the value to return an efficient guard. any other operator isn't valid. conservatively match everything. There's a tradeoff between being precise and being fast. For example, if the delete includes a very expensive regex, we don't want to run that against every incoming point. The decision here is to match any point that has a possibly expensive match if there is any overlap on the tags. In other words, expensive matches get transformed into trivially matching everything. We could do a better job here by encoding the two names and checking the points against them, but I'm not quite sure how to do that. Be conservative and match any points that contain either the key or value. since every point has a measurement, always match if either are on the measurement. any other value type matches everything matches checks if the exprGuard matches the point./Users/austinjaybecker/projects/abeck-go-testing/tsdb/index/Users/austinjaybecker/projects/abeck-go-testing/tsdb/index/index.go import "github.com/influxdata/influxdb/v2/tsdb/index"/Users/austinjaybecker/projects/abeck-go-testing/tsdb/index/inmem/Users/austinjaybecker/projects/abeck-go-testing/tsdb/index/inmem/inmem.goNewShardIndexerrMaxSeriesPerDatabaseExceededevictSeriesIDsintersectSeriesFiltersnewEvictSeriesIDsnewMeasurementnewSeriesnewStringSetnewTagKeyValuenewTagKeyValueEntryseriesIDseriesIDIteratorunionSeriesFiltersskeyhasNewSeriesignoreLimitsnewSeriesNseriesListsIDsauthorizedkeyIdxskeysSortedtagValstagMatchvalEqualshardSeriesIDsmaxValuesPerTagdroppedKeysnextKeysgithub.com/influxdata/influxdb/v2/pkg/estimator/hll"github.com/influxdata/influxdb/v2/pkg/estimator/hll"left side of '%s' must be a tag key"left side of '%s' must be a tag key"IsRegexOpright side of '%s' must be a regular expression"right side of '%s' must be a regular expression"right side of '%s' must be a tag value string"right side of '%s' must be a tag value string"invalid tag comparison operator"invalid tag comparison operator"max-values-per-tag limit exceeded (%d/%d): measurement=%q tag=%q value=%q"max-values-per-tag limit exceeded (%d/%d): measurement=%q tag=%q value=%q"max-series-per-database limit exceeded: (%d)"max-series-per-database limit exceeded: (%d)"
Package inmem implements a shared, in-memory index for each database.

The in-memory index is the original index implementation and provides fast
access to index data. However, it also forces high memory usage for large
datasets and can cause OOM errors.

Index is the shared index structure that provides most of the functionality.
However, ShardIndex is a light per-shard wrapper that adapts this original
shared index format to the new per-shard format.
 IndexName is the name of this index. Index is the in memory index of a collection of measurements, time series, and their tags. Exported functions are goroutine safe while un-exported functions assume the caller will use the appropriate locks. In-memory metadata index, built on load and updated when new series come in measurement name to object and index map series key to the Series object Mutex to control rebuilds of the index NewIndex returns a new initialized Index. Bytes estimates the memory footprint of this Index, in bytes. mu RWMutex is 24 bytes Do not count SeriesFile because it belongs to the code that constructed this Index. rebuildQueue Mutex is 8 bytes Database returns the name of the database the index was initialized with. Series returns a series by key. SeriesSketches returns the sketches for the series. Measurement returns the measurement object from the index by the name MeasurementExists returns true if the measurement exists. MeasurementsSketches returns the sketches for the measurements. MeasurementsByName returns a list of measurements. MeasurementIterator returns an iterator over all measurements in the index. MeasurementIterator does not support authorization. CreateSeriesListIfNotExists adds the series for the given measurement to the index and sets its ID or returns the existing series object Verify that the series will not exceed limit. If there is a series for this ID, it's already been added. This series might need to be added to the local bitset, if the series was created on another shard. get or create the measurement index Check for the series again under a write lock Note, keys may contain duplicates (e.g., because of points for the same series in the same batch). If the duplicate series are new, the index must be rechecked on each iteration. set the in memory ID for query processing on this shard The series key and tags are clone to prevent a memory leak Add the series to the series sketch. This series needs to be added to the bitset tracking undeleted series IDs. CreateMeasurementIndexIfNotExists creates or retrieves an in memory index object for the measurement See if the measurement exists using a read-lock Doesn't exist, so lock the index to create it Make sure it was created in between the time we released our read-lock and acquire the write lock Add the measurement to the measurements sketch. HasTagKey returns true if tag key exists. HasTagValue returns true if tag value exists. TagValueN returns the cardinality of a tag value. MeasurementTagKeysByExpr returns an ordered set of tag keys filtered by an expression. TagKeyHasAuthorizedSeries determines if there exists an authorized series for the provided measurement name and tag key. TODO(edd): This looks like it's inefficient. Since a series can have multiple tag key/value pairs on it, it's possible that the same unauthorised series will be checked multiple times. It would be more efficient if it were possible to get the set of unique series IDs for a given measurement name and tag key. This tag key/value combination doesn't have any authorised series, so keep checking other tag values. MeasurementTagKeyValuesByExpr returns a set of tag values filtered by an expression. See tsm1.Engine.MeasurementTagKeyValuesByExpr for a fuller description of this method. If we haven't been provided sorted keys, then we need to sort them. This is the case where we have filtered series by some WHERE condition. We only care about the tag values for the keys given the filtered set of series ids. Iterate all series to collect tag values. Iterate the tag keys we're interested in and collect values from this series, if they exist. The tag key is > the largest key we're interested in. ForEachMeasurementTagKey iterates over all tag keys for a measurement. Ensure we do not hold a lock on the index while fn executes in case fn tries to acquire a lock on the index again.  If another goroutine has Lock, this will deadlock. TagKeyCardinality returns the number of values for a measurement/tag key. TagsForSeries returns the tag map for the passed in series MeasurementNamesByExpr takes an expression containing only tags and returns a list of matching measurement names. TODO(edd): Remove authorisation from these methods. There shouldn't need to be any auth passed down into the index. Return all measurement names if no expression is provided. Match on name, if specified. measurementNamesByNameFilter returns the sorted measurements matching a name. measurementNamesByTagFilters returns the sorted measurements matching the filters on tag values. Build a list of measurements matching the filters. Iterate through all measurements in the database. Authorization must be explicitly granted when an authorizer is present. Check the tag values belonging to the tag key for equivalence to the tag value being filtered on. No match. Keep checking. No need to continue checking series, there is a match. Is there a series with this matching tag value that is authorized to be read? If the series is deleted then it can't be used to authorise against. The Range call can return early as a matching tag value with an authorized series has been found. The matching tag value doesn't have any authorized series. Check for other matching tag values if this is a regex check. For negation operators, to determine if the measurement is authorized, an authorized series belonging to the measurement must be located. Then, the measurement can be added iff !tagMatch && authorized. tags match | operation is EQ | measurement matches --------------------------------------------------     True   |       True      |      True     True   |       False     |      False     False  |       True      |      False     False  |       False     |      True MeasurementNamesByRegex returns the measurements that match the regex. DropMeasurement removes the measurement and all of its underlying series from the database index Update the tombstone sketch. DropMeasurementIfSeriesNotExist drops a measurement only if there are no more series for the measurement. DropSeriesGlobal removes the series key and its tags from the index. Remove from the index. Remove the measurement's reference. Mark the series as deleted. If the measurement no longer has any series, remove it as well. TagSets returns a list of tag sets. SetFieldSet sets a shared field set from the engine. FieldSet returns the assigned fieldset. SetFieldName adds a field name to a measurement. ForEachMeasurementName iterates over each measurement name. TagValueIterator provides an iterator over all the tag values belonging to series with the provided measurement name and tag key. TagValueIterator does not currently support authorization. Return all series if no condition specified. Get series IDs that match the WHERE clause. Delete boolean literal true filter expressions. These are returned for `WHERE tagKey = 'tagVal'` type expressions and are okay. Check for unsupported field filters. Any remaining filters means there were fields (e.g., `WHERE value = 1.2`). SeriesIDIterator returns an influxql iterator over matching series ids. Read and sort all measurements. DiskSizeBytes always returns zero bytes, since this is an in-memory index. Rebuild recreates the measurement indexes to allow deleted series to be removed and garbage collected. Only allow one rebuild at a time.  This will cause all subsequent rebuilds to queue.  The measurement rebuild is idempotent and will not be rebuilt if it does not need to be. Measurement never returns an error assignExistingSeries assigns the existing series to shardID and returns the series, names and tags that do not exists yet. Add the existing series to this shard's bitset, since this may be the first time the series is added to this shard. Ensure index implements interface. ShardIndex represents a shim between the TSDB index interface and the shared in-memory index. This is required because per-shard in-memory indexes will grow the heap size too large. shard id Shared reference to global database-wide index. Bitset storing all undeleted series IDs associated with this shard. mapping of measurements to the count of series ids in the set. protected by the seriesIDSet lock. DropSeries removes the provided series id from the local bitset that tracks series in this shard only. Remove from shard-local bitset if it exists. we always report the measurement was dropped if it does not exist in our measurements mapping. CreateSeriesListIfNotExists creates a list of series if they doesn't exist in bulk. Ensure that no tags go over the maximum cardinality. Skip if the tag value already exists. Read cardinality. Skip if we're below the threshold. Increment success count if all checks complete. Slice to only include successful points. Report partial writes back to shard. number dropped before deduping SeriesN returns the number of unique non-tombstoned series local to this shard. InitializeSeries is called during start-up. This works the same as CreateSeriesListIfNotExists except it ignore limit errors. CreateSeriesIfNotExists creates the provided series on the index if it is not already present. TagSets returns a list of tag sets based on series filtering. SeriesIDSet returns the bitset associated with the series ids. NewShardIndex returns a new index for a shard. seriesIDIterator emits series ids. Stats returns stats about the points processed. Next emits the next point in the iterator. Load next measurement's keys if there are no more remaining. Read the next key. nextKeys reads all keys for the next measurement. Ensure previous keys are cleared out. Read next measurement.

Authorized determines if this Measurement is authorized to be read, according to the provided Authorizer. A measurement is authorized to be read if at least one undeleted series from the measurement is authorized to be read. Note(edd): the cost of this check scales linearly with the number of series belonging to a measurement, which means it may become expensive when there are large numbers of series on a measurement. In the future we might want to push the set of series down into the authorizer, but that will require an API change. SeriesByID returns a series by identifier. SeriesByIDMap returns the internal seriesByID map. SeriesByIDSlice returns a list of series by identifiers. AppendSeriesKeysByID appends keys for a list of series ids to a buffer. SeriesKeysByID returns the a list of keys for a set of ids. SeriesKeys returns the keys of every series in this measurement HasTagKey returns true if at least one series in this measurement has written a value for the passed in tag key HasSeries returns true if there is at least 1 series under this measurement. CardinalityBytes returns the number of values associated with the given tag key. AddSeries adds a series to the measurement's index.

Nothing needs to be rebuilt. Create a new measurement from the state of the existing measurement Re-add each series to allow the measurement indexes to get re-created.  If there were deletes, the existing measurement may have references to deleted series that need to be expunged.  Note: we're NOT using SeriesIDs which returns the series in sorted order because we need to do this under a write lock to prevent races.  The series are added in sorted order to prevent resorting them again after they are all re-added. Explicitly set the new measurement on the series. filters walks the where clause of a select statement and returns a map with all series ids matching the where clause and any filter expression that should be applied to each TagSets returns the unique tag sets that exist for the given tag keys. This is used to determine what composite series will be created by a group by. i.e. "group by region" should return: {"region":"uswest"}, {"region":"useast"} or region, service returns {"region": "uswest", "service": "redis"}, {"region": "uswest", "service": "mysql"}, etc... This will also populate the TagSet objects with the series IDs that match each tagset and any influx filter expression that goes with the series TODO: this shouldn't be exported. However, until tx.go and the engine get refactored into tsdb, we need it. get the unique set of series ids and the filters that should be applied to each For every series, get the tag values for the requested tag keys i.e. dimensions. This is the TagSet for that series. Series with the same TagSet are then grouped together, because for the purpose of GROUP BY they are part of the same composite series. This TagSet is new, create a new entry for it. Associate the series and filter with the Tagset. Release the lock while we sort all the tags Sort the series in each tag set. The TagSets have been created, as a map of TagSets. Just send the values back as a slice, sorting for consistency. intersectSeriesFilters performs an intersection for two sets of ids and filter expressions. We only want to allocate a slice and map of the smaller size. They're in sorted order so advance the counter as needed. This is, don't run comparisons against lower values that we've already passed. unionSeriesFilters performs a union for two sets of ids and filter expressions. Setup the filters with the smallest size since we will discard filters that do not have a match on the other side. If one side does not have a filter, then the series has been included on one side of the OR with no condition. Eliminate the filter in this case. Now append the remainder. SeriesIDsByTagKey returns a list of all series for a tag key. SeriesIDsByTagValue returns a list of all series for a tag value. IDsForExpr returns the series IDs that are candidates to match the given expression. idsForExpr returns a collection of series ids and a filter expression that should be used to filter points from those series. If this binary expression has another binary expression, then this is some expression math and we should just pass it to the underlying query. Retrieve the variable reference from the correct side of the expression. This is an expression we do not know how to evaluate. Let the query engine take care of this. For fields, return all series IDs from this measurement and return the expression passed in, as the filter. Check if the RHS is a variable and if it is a field. Retrieve list of series with this tag key. if we're looking for series with a specific tag value Special handling for "_name" to match measurement name. return series that have a tag of specific value. Make a copy of all series ids and mark the ones we need to evict. Go through each slice and mark the values we find as zero so they can be removed later. Make a new slice with only the remaining ids. if we're looking for series with a tag value that matches a regex Check if we match the empty string to see if we should include series that are missing the tag. Gather the series that match the regex. If we should include the empty string, start with the list of all series and reject series that don't match our condition. If we should not include the empty string, include series that match our condition. See comments above for EQ with a StringLiteral. compare tag values We do not know how to evaluate this expression so pass it on to the query engine. FilterExprs represents a map of series IDs to filter expressions. DeleteBoolLiteralTrues deletes all elements whose filter expression is a boolean literal true. Len returns the number of elements. WalkWhereForSeriesIds recursively walks the WHERE clause and returns an ordered set of series IDs and a map from those series IDs to filter expressions that should be used to limit points returned in the final query result. Get the series IDs and filter expression for the tag or field comparison. If the expression is a boolean literal that is true, ignore it. Get the series IDs and filter expressions for the LHS. Get the series IDs and filter expressions for the RHS. Combine the series IDs from the LHS and RHS. walk down the tree SeriesIDsAllOrByExpr walks an expressions for matching series IDs or, if no expressions is given, returns all series IDs for the measurement. If no expression given or the measurement has no series, we can take just return the ids or nil accordingly. tagKeysByExpr extracts the tag keys wanted by the expression. tagKeysByFilter will filter the tag keys for the measurement. Measurements represents a list of *Measurement. series belong to a Measurement and represent unique time series in a database. immutable newSeries returns an initialized series struct bytes estimates the memory footprint of this series, in bytes. RWMutex uses 24 bytes Do not count s.Measurement to prevent double-counting in Index.Bytes. Delete marks this series as deleted.  A deleted series should not be returned for queries. Deleted indicates if this was previously deleted. TagKeyValue provides goroutine-safe concurrent access to the set of series ids mapping to a set of tag values. bytes estimates the memory footprint of this tagKeyValue, in bytes. RWMutex is 24 bytes uint64 NewTagKeyValue initialises a new TagKeyValue. Cardinality returns the number of values in the TagKeyValue. Contains returns true if the TagKeyValue contains value. InsertSeriesIDByte adds a series id to the tag key value. Load returns the SeriesIDs for the provided tag value. TagKeyValue is a no-op. If f returns false then iteration over any remaining keys or values will cease. RangeAll calls f sequentially on each key and value. A call to RangeAll on a nil TagKeyValue is a no-op. series id set lazily sorted list of series. SeriesIDs is a convenience type for sorting, checking equality, and doing union and intersection of collections of series ids. Equals assumes that both are sorted. Intersect returns a new collection of series ids in sorted order that is the intersection of the two. The two collections must already be sorted. we want to iterate through the shortest one and stop they're in sorted order so advance the counter as needed. That is, don't run comparisons against lower values that we've already passed Union returns a new collection of series ids in sorted order that is the union of the two. now append the remainder Reject returns a new collection of series ids in sorted order with the passed in set removed from the original. This is useful for the NOT operator. The two collections must already be sorted. Append the remainder seriesID is a series id that may or may not have been evicted from the current id list. evictSeriesIDs is a slice of SeriesIDs with an extra field to mark if the field should be evicted or not. newEvictSeriesIDs copies the ids into a new slice that can be used for evicting series from the slice. mark marks all of the ids in the sorted slice to be evicted from the list of series ids. If an id to be evicted does not exist, it just gets ignored. Perform a binary search of the remaining slice if the first element does not match the value we're looking for. Skip over this series since it has been evicted and won't be encountered again. evict creates a new slice with only the series that have not been evicted. TagFilter represents a tag filter when looking up other tags or measurements. TagKeys returns a list of the measurement's tag names, in sorted order. TagValues returns all the values for the given tag key, in an arbitrary order. SetFieldName adds the field name to the measurement. SeriesByTagKeyValue returns the TagKeyValue for the provided tag key. stringSet represents a set of strings. newStringSet returns an empty stringSet. add adds strings to the set. list returns the current elements in the set, in sorted order. union returns the union of this set and another. intersect returns the intersection of this set and another./Users/austinjaybecker/projects/abeck-go-testing/tsdb/index/tsi1/Users/austinjaybecker/projects/abeck-go-testing/tsdb/index/tsi1/cache.goCompactingExtDefaultCompactionLevelsDefaultPartitionNErrCompactionInterruptedErrIncompatibleVersionErrInvalidIndexFileErrLogEntryChecksumMismatchErrMeasurementBlockSizeMismatchErrTagBlockSizeMismatchErrUnsupportedIndexFileVersionErrUnsupportedMeasurementBlockVersionErrUnsupportedTagBlockVersionFileSignatureFormatIndexFileNameFormatLogFileNameIndexFileExtIndexFileTrailerIndexFileTrailerSizeIndexFileVersionIndexFileVersionSizeIndexFilesInfoIsIndexDirIsPartitionDirLogEntryMeasurementTombstoneFlagLogEntrySeriesTombstoneFlagLogEntryTagKeyTombstoneFlagLogEntryTagValueTombstoneFlagLogFileExtManifestFileNameMaxIndexFileSizeMaxIndexMergeCountMeasurementBlockTrailerMeasurementBlockVersionMeasurementBlockWriterMeasurementElemsMeasurementFillSizeMeasurementNSizeMeasurementOffsetSizeMeasurementSeriesIDSetFlagMeasurementTombstoneFlagMeasurementTrailerSizeNewFileSetNewIndexFileNewLogFileNewManifestNewMeasurementBlockWriterNewPartitionNewTSDBMeasurementIteratorAdapterNewTSDBTagKeyIteratorAdapterNewTSDBTagValueIteratorAdapterNewTagBlockEncoderNewTagValueSeriesIDCacheParseFilenameReadIndexFileTrailerReadManifestFileReadMeasurementBlockTrailerReadTagBlockTrailerTagBlockEncoderTagBlockTrailerTagBlockTrailerSizeTagBlockVersionTagKeyNSizeTagKeyOffsetSizeTagKeyTombstoneFlagTagValueNSizeTagValueOffsetSizeTagValueSeriesIDSetFlagTagValueTombstoneFlagWithSeriesIDCacheSizeappendLogEntryblockMeasurementIteratordefaultLogFileBufferSizeencodeTagKeyFlagencodeTagValueFlagfileIDRegexfileSetMeasurementIteratorfileSetSeriesIDIteratorfileSetSeriesIDSetIteratorfileSetTagKeyIteratorfileSetTagValueIteratorindexCompactInfoindexFileBufferSizeindexTagSetPosintersectStringSetsjoinIntSlicelogMeasurementIteratorlogMeasurementSlicelogTagKeyIteratorlogTagKeySlicelogTagValueIteratorlogTagValueSlicemeasurementMergeElemnewFileSetMeasurementIteratornewFileSetSeriesIDIteratornewFileSetTagKeyIteratornewFileSetTagValueIteratornewLogFileCompactInfonewLogTagKeyIteratornewLogTagValueIteratorquoteSQLrawSeriesIDIteratorseriesIDCacheElementsqlReplacertagBlockKeyIteratortagBlockValueIteratortagKeyEncodeEntrytagKeyMergeElemtagValueMergeElemtoValidUTF8tsdbMeasurementIteratorAdaptertsdbTagKeyIteratorAdaptertsdbTagValueIteratorAdapterunionStringSetsuvarintwriteSketchTowriteUint16TowriteUint64TowriteUint8TowriteUvarintToeletkmaplistElementEVICT TagValueSeriesIDCache is an LRU cache for series id sets associated with name -> key -> value mappings. The purpose of the cache is to provide efficient means to get sets of series ids that would otherwise involve merging many individual bitmaps at query time. When initialising a TagValueSeriesIDCache a capacity must be provided. When more than c items are added to the cache, the least recently used item is evicted from the cache. A TagValueSeriesIDCache comprises a linked list implementation to track the order by which items should be evicted from the cache, and a hashmap implementation to provide constant time retrievals of items from the cache. NewTagValueSeriesIDCache returns a TagValueSeriesIDCache with capacity c. Get returns the SeriesIDSet associated with the {name, key, value} tuple if it This now becomes most recently used. exists returns true if the an item exists for the tuple {name, key, value}. addToSet adds x to the SeriesIDSet associated with the tuple {name, key, value} if it exists. This method takes a lock on the underlying SeriesIDSet. NB this does not count as an access on the set—therefore the set is not promoted within the LRU cache. measurementContainsSets returns true if there are sets cached for the provided measurement. Put adds the SeriesIDSet to the cache under the tuple {name, key, value}. If the cache is at its limit, then the least recently used item is evicted. Check under the write lock if the relevant item is now in the cache. Ensure our SeriesIDSet is go heap backed. Create list item, and add to the front of the eviction list. Add the listElement to the set of items. Add the set to the map No series set map for the tag key - first tag value for the tag key. No map for the measurement - first tag key for the measurement. Delete removes x from the tuple {name, key, value} if it exists.

Package tsi1 provides a memory-mapped index implementation that supports
high cardinality series.

Overview

The top-level object in tsi1 is the Index. It is the primary access point from
the rest of the system. The Index is composed of LogFile and IndexFile objects.

Log files are small write-ahead log files that record new series immediately
in the order that they are received. The data within the file is indexed
in-memory so it can be quickly accessed. When the system is restarted, this log
file is replayed and the in-memory representation is rebuilt.

Index files also contain series information, however, they are highly indexed
so that reads can be performed quickly. Index files are built through a process
called compaction where a log file or multiple index files are merged together.


Operations

The index can perform many tasks related to series, measurement, & tag data.
All data is inserted by adding a series to the index. When adding a series,
the measurement, tag keys, and tag values are all extracted and indexed
separately.

Once a series has been added, it can be removed in several ways. First, the
individual series can be removed. Second, it can be removed as part of a bulk
operation by deleting the entire measurement.

The query engine needs to be able to look up series in a variety of ways such
as by measurement name, by tag value, or by using regular expressions. The
index provides an API to iterate over subsets of series and perform set
operations such as unions and intersections.


Log File Layout

The write-ahead file that series initially are inserted into simply appends
all new operations sequentially. It is simply composed of a series of log
entries. An entry contains a flag to specify the operation type, the measurement
name, the tag set, and a checksum.

	┃ └──────────────────────┘ ┃
	┗━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┛

When the log file is replayed, if the checksum is incorrect or the entry is
incomplete (because of a partially failed write) then the log is truncated.


Index File Layout

The index file is composed of 3 main block types: one series block, one or more
tag blocks, and one measurement block. At the end of the index file is a
trailer that records metadata such as the offsets to these blocks.


Series Block Layout

The series block stores raw series keys in sorted order. It also provides hash
indexes so that series can be looked up quickly. Hash indexes are inserted
periodically so that memory size is limited at write time. Once all the series
and hash indexes have been written then a list of index entries are written
so that hash indexes can be looked up via binary search.

The end of the block contains two HyperLogLog++ sketches which track the
estimated number of created series and deleted series. After the sketches is
a trailer which contains metadata about the block.

Tag Block Layout

After the series block is one or more tag blocks. One of these blocks exists
for every measurement in the index file. The block is structured as a sorted
list of values for each key and then a sorted list of keys. Each of these lists
has their own hash index for fast direct lookups.

Each entry for values contains a sorted list of offsets for series keys that use
that value. Series iterators can be built around a single tag key value or
multiple iterators can be merged with set operators such as union or
intersection.


Measurement block

The measurement block stores a sorted list of measurements, their associated
series offsets, and the offset to their tag block. This allows all series for
a measurement to be traversed quickly and it allows fast direct lookups of
measurements and their tags.

This block also contains HyperLogLog++ sketches for new and deleted
measurements.

Manifest file

The index is simply an ordered set of log and index files. These files can be
merged together or rewritten but their order must always be the same. This is
because series, measurements, & tags can be marked as deleted (aka tombstoned)
and this action needs to be tracked in time order.

Whenever the set of active files is changed, a manifest file is written to
track the set. The manifest specifies the ordering of files and, on startup,
all files not in the manifest are removed from the index directory.


Compacting index files

Compaction is the process of taking files and merging them together into a
single file. There are two stages of compaction within TSI.

First, once log files exceed a size threshold then they are compacted into an
index file. This threshold is relatively small because log files must maintain
their index in the heap which TSI tries to avoid. Small log files are also very
quick to convert into an index file so this is done aggressively.

Second, once a contiguous set of index files exceed a factor (e.g. 10x) then
they are all merged together into a single index file and the old files are
discarded. Because all blocks are written in sorted order, the new index file
can be streamed and minimize memory use.


Concurrency

Index files are immutable so they do not require fine grained locks, however,
compactions require that we track which files are in use so they are not
discarded too soon. This is done by using reference counting with file sets.

A file set is simply an ordered list of index files. When the current file set
is obtained from the index, a counter is incremented to track its usage. Once
the user is done with the file set, it is released and the counter is
decremented. A file cannot be removed from the file system until this counter
returns to zero.

Besides the reference counting, there are no other locking mechanisms when
reading or writing index files. Log files, however, do require a lock whenever
they are accessed. This is another reason to minimize log file size.

ErrCompactionInterrupted is returned if compactions are disabled or an index is closed while a compaction is occurring. DefaultPartitionN determines how many shards the index will be partitioned into. NOTE: Currently, this must not be change once a database is created. Further, it must also be a power of 2. An IndexOption is a functional option for changing the configuration of an Index. WithPath sets the root path of the Index DisableCompactions disables compactions on the Index. WithLogger sets the logger for the Index. WithMaximumLogFileSize sets the maximum size of LogFiles before they're compacted into IndexFiles. DisableFsync disables flushing and syncing of underlying files. Primarily this impacts the LogFiles. This option can be set when working with the index in an offline manner, for cases where a hard failure can be overcome by re-running the tooling. WithLogFileBufferSize sets the size of the buffer used within LogFiles. Typically appending an entry to a LogFile involves writing 11 or 12 bytes, so depending on how many new series are being created within a batch, it may be appropriate to set this. 128K 4K (runtime default) WithSeriesIDCacheSize sets the size of the series id set cache. If set to 0, then the cache is disabled. Index represents a collection of layered index files and WAL. The following may be set when initializing an Index. Root directory of the index partitions.

Measurement sketches Series sketches Index's version. Number of partitions used by the index. NewIndex returns a new instance of Index. WithLogger sets the logger on the index after it's been created. It's not safe to call WithLogger after the index has been opened, or before it has been closed. Type returns the type of Index this is. SeriesFile returns the series file attached to the index. SeriesIDSet returns the set of series ids associated with series in this index. Any series IDs for series no longer present in the index are filtered out. Open opens the index. Ensure root exists. Initialize index partitions. Open all the Partitions in parallel. Store results. Run fn on each partition using a fixed number of goroutines. Index of maximum Partition being worked on. Refresh cached sketches. Mark opened. Compact requests a compaction of partitions. Wait blocks until all outstanding compactions have completed. Close closes the index. Lock index and close partitions. Mark index as closed. Path returns the path the index was opened with.

ForEachMeasurementName iterates over all measurement names in the index, applying fn. It returns the first error encountered, if any. ForEachMeasurementName does not call fn on each partition concurrently so the call may provide a non-goroutine safe fn. Iterate over all measurements. MeasurementExists returns true if a measurement exists. Store errors Use this to signal we found the measurement. Check each partition for the measurement concurrently. Get next partition to check Check if the measurement has been found. If it has don't need to check this partition and can just move on. Check if we found the measurement. MeasurementHasSeries returns true if a measurement has non-tombstoned series. fetchByteValues is a helper for gathering values from each partition in the index, based on some criteria. fn is a function that works on partition idx and calls into some method on the partition that returns some ordered values. This is safe since there are no readers on names until all the writers are done. It's now safe to read from names. MeasurementIterator returns an iterator over all measurements. MeasurementSeriesIDIterator returns an iterator over all series in a measurement. MeasurementNamesByRegex returns measurement names for the provided regex. DropMeasurement deletes a measurement from the index. It returns the first error encountered, if any. Update sketches under lock. All slices must be of equal length. We need to move different series into collections for each partition to process. Determine partition for series using each series key. Process each subset of series on each partition. Store errors. Some cached bitset results may need to be updated. TODO(edd): It's not clear to me yet whether it will be better to take a lock on every series id set, or whether to gather them all up under the cache rlock and then take the cache lock and update them all at once (without invoking a lock on each series id set). Taking the cache lock will block all queries, but is one lock. Taking each series set lock might be many lock/unlocks but will only block a query that needs that particular set. Need to think on it, but I think taking a lock on each series id set is the way to go. One other option here is to take a lock on the series id set when we first encounter it and then keep it locked until we're done with all the ids. Note: this will only add `id` to the set if it exists. Takes a lock on the series id set CreateSeriesIfNotExists creates a series if it doesn't exist or is deleted. No new series, nothing further to update. If there are cached sets for any of the tag pairs, they will need to be updated with the series id. Note this will only add `id` to the set if it exists. InitializeSeries is a no-op. This only applies to the in-memory index. DropSeries drops the provided series from the index.  If cascade is true and this is the last series to the measurement, the measurement will also be dropped. Remove from partition. Add sketch tombstone. Extract measurement name & tags. Check if that was the last series for the measurement in the entire index. If no more series exist in the measurement then delete the measurement. DropSeriesGlobal is a no-op on the tsi1 index. MeasurementsSketches returns the two measurement sketches for the index. SeriesSketches returns the two series sketches for the index. Since indexes are not shared across shards, the count returned by SeriesN cannot be combined with other shard's results. If you need to count series across indexes then use either the database-wide series file, or merge the index-level bitsets or sketches. HasTagKey returns true if tag key exists. It returns the first error encountered if any. Use this to signal we found the tag key. Check each partition for the tag key concurrently. Check if the tag key has already been found. If it has, we don't need to check this partition and can just move on. Check if we found the tag key. TagKeyIterator returns an iterator for all keys across a single measurement. TagValueIterator returns an iterator for all values across a single key. Check series ID set cache... Return a clone because the set is mutable. Check if the iterator contains only series id sets. Cache them... This is safe since there are no readers on keys until all Merge into single map. DiskSizeBytes returns the size of the index on disk. Get MANIFEST sizes from each partition. TagKeyCardinality always returns zero. It is not possible to determine cardinality of tags across index files, and thus it cannot be done across partitions. RetainFileSet returns the set of all files across all partitions. This is only needed when all files need to be retained for an operation. SetFieldName is a no-op on this index. Rebuild rebuilds an index. It's a no-op for this index.

Convert result sets into []string TagSets returns an ordered list of tag sets for a measurement by dimension and filtered by an optional conditional expression. measurementSeriesByExprIterator filters deleted series IDs; no need to do so here. For every series, get the tag values for the requested tag keys i.e. dimensions. This is the TagSet for that series. Series with the same TagSet are then grouped together, because for the purpose of GROUP BY they are part of the same composite series. The tag sets require a string for each series key in the set, The series file formatted keys need to be parsed into models format. Since they will end up as strings we can re-use an intermediate buffer for this process. Buffer for tags. Tags are not needed outside of each loop iteration. Skip if the series has been tombstoned. check every 16384 series if the query has been canceled NOTE - must not escape this loop iteration. Ensure it's back in the map.

A ShardError implements the error interface, and contains extra context about the shard that generated the error. NewShardError returns a new ShardError. PartialWriteError indicates a write request could only write a portion of the requested values. A sorted slice of series keys that were dropped. Shard represents a self-contained time series database. An inverted index of the measurement and tag data is kept along with the raw time series data. Data can be split across many shards. The query engine in TSDB is responsible for combining the output of many shards into a single query result. expvar-based stats. CompactionDisabled specifies the shard should not schedule compactions. NewShard returns a new initialized Shard. walPath doesn't apply to the b1 type index WithLogger sets the logger on the shard. It must be called before Open.

Initialize underlying engine. Set log output on the engine. Disable compactions while loading the index Open engine. Load metadata index for the inmem index only. enable writes, queries and compactions Close shuts down the shard's store. close closes the shard an removes reference to the shard from associated indexes, unless clean is false. IndexType returns the index version being used for this shard. IndexType returns the empty string if it is called before the shard is opened, since it is only that point that the underlying index type is known. Shard not open yet. ready determines if the Shard is ready for queries or writes. It returns nil if ready, otherwise ErrShardClosed or ErrShardDisabled Index returns a reference to the underlying index. It returns an error if the index is nil. SeriesFile returns a reference the underlying series file. If return an error if the series file is nil. IsIdle return true if the shard is not receiving writes and is fully compacted. Disable compactions to stop background goroutines SetCompactionsEnabled enables or disable shard background compactions. DiskSize returns the size on disk of this shard. We don't use engine() because we still want to report the shard's disk size even if the shard has been disabled. FieldCreate holds information for a field to create on a measurement. WritePoints will write the raw data points and any new metadata to the index in the shard. There was a partial write (points dropped), hold onto the error to return to the caller, but continue on writing the remaining points. add any new fields and keep track of what needs to be saved Write to the engine. validateSeriesAndFields checks which series and fields are new and whose metadata should be saved and indexed. only first error reason is set unless returned from CreateSeriesListIfNotExists Create all series against the index in bulk. Check if keys should be unicode validated. Drop any series w/ a "time" tag, these are illegal Drop any series with invalid unicode characters in the key. Add new series. Check for partial writes. TODO(jmw): why is this a *PartialWriteError when everything else is not a pointer? Maybe we can just change it to be consistent if we change it also in all the places that construct it. Skip any points with only invalid fields. Skip any points whos keys have been dropped. Dropped has already been incremented for them. Check with the field validator. Create any fields that are missing. Skip fields named "time". They are illegal. add fields DeleteSeriesRange deletes all values from for seriesKeys between min and max (inclusive) DeleteSeriesRangeWithPredicate deletes all values from for seriesKeys between min and max (inclusive) for which predicate() returns true. If predicate() is nil, then all values in range are deleted. DeleteMeasurement deletes a measurement and all underlying series. SeriesN returns the unique number of series in the shard. SeriesSketches returns the measurement sketches for the shard. MeasurementsSketches returns the measurement sketches for the shard. MeasurementNamesByRegex returns names of measurements matching the regular expression. MeasurementTagKeysByExpr returns all the tag keys for the provided expression.

MeasurementFields returns fields for a measurement. MeasurementExists returns true if the shard contains name. TODO(edd): This method is currently only being called from tests; do we really need it? WriteTo writes the shard's data to w. CreateIterator returns an iterator for the data in the shard. TODO(benbjohnson): Move up to the Shards.CreateIterator(). FieldDimensions returns unique sets of fields and dimensions across a list of sources. Handle system sources. Unknown system source so default to looking for a measurement. Retrieve measurement. Append fields and dimensions. mapType returns the data type for the field within the measurement. Process system measurements. expandSources expands regex sources and removes duplicates. NOTE: sources must be normalized (db and rp set) before calling this function. Use a map as a set to prevent duplicates. Iterate all sources, expanding regexes when they're found. Add non-regex measurements directly to the set. Loop over matching measurements. Convert set to sorted slice. Convert set to a list of Sources. Backup backs up the shard by creating a tar archive of all TSM files that have been modified since the provided time. See Engine.Backup for more details. Restore restores data to the underlying engine for the shard. The shard is reopened after restore. Special case - we can still restore to a disabled shard, so we should only check if the engine is closed and not care if the shard is disabled. Restore to engine. Close shard. Reopen engine. Import imports data to the underlying engine for the shard. r should be a reader from a backup created by Backup. Special case - we can still import to a disabled shard, so we should Import to engine. CreateSnapshot will return a path to a temp directory containing hard links to the underlying shard files. ForEachMeasurementName iterates over each measurement in the shard. Digest returns a digest of the shard. Make sure the shard is idle/cold. (No use creating a digest of a hot shard that is rapidly changing.) engine safely (under an RLock) returns a reference to the shard's Engine, or an error if the Engine is closed, or the shard is currently disabled. The shard's Engine should always be accessed via a call to engine(), rather than directly referencing Shard.engine. If a caller needs an Engine reference but is already under a lock, then they should use engineNoLock(). engineNoLock is similar to calling engine(), but the caller must guarantee that they already hold an appropriate lock. Shards represents a sortable list of shards. MeasurementsByRegex returns the unique set of measurements matching the provided regex, for all the shards. Skip this shard's results—previous behaviour. FieldKeysByMeasurement returns a de-duplicated, sorted, set of field keys for the provided measurement name. MeasurementNamesByPredicate returns the measurements that match the given predicate.

CreateFieldIfNotExists creates a new field with an autoincrementing ID. Returns an error if 255 fields have already been created on the measurement or the fields already exists with a different type. Ignore if the field already exists. Re-check field and type under write lock. Create and append a new field. Field returns the field for name, or nil if there is no field for name. FieldBytes returns the field for name, or nil if there is no field for name. FieldBytes should be preferred to Field when the caller has a []byte, because it avoids a string allocation, which can't be avoided if the caller converts the []byte to a string and calls Field. FieldSet returns the set of fields and their types for the measurement. MeasurementFieldSet represents a collection of fields by measurement. This safe for concurrent use. path is the location to persist field sets NewMeasurementFieldSet returns a new instance of MeasurementFieldSet. If there is a load error, return the error and an empty set so it can be rebuild manually. Bytes estimates the memory footprint of this MeasurementFieldSet, in bytes.

Store manages shards and indexes for databases. Determines size of series file mmap. Can be altered in tests. shared per-database indexes, only if using "inmem". Maintains a set of shards that are in the process of deletion. This prevents new shards from being created while old ones are being deleted. Epoch tracker helps serialize writes and deletes that may conflict. It is stored by shard. NewStore returns a new store with the given path and a default configuration. The returned store must be initialized by calling Open before using it. WithLogger sets the logger for the store. Statistics returns statistics for period monitoring. Add all the series and measurements cardinality estimations. Gather all statistics for all shards. Build index set to work on. Path returns the store's root path. Open initializes the store, creating all necessary directories, loading all shards as well as initializing periodic maintenance of them. Create directory. res holds the result from opening each shard in a goroutine Limit the number of concurrent TSM files to be opened to the number of cores. Setup a shared limiter for compactions Default to 50% of cores for compactions Don't allow more compactions to run than cores. Determine how many shards we need to open by checking the store path. Load series file. Retrieve database index. Load each retention policy within the database directory. The .series directory is not a retention policy. Series file should not be in a retention policy but skip just in case. Shard file names are numeric shardIDs Copy options and assign shared index. Provide an implementation of the ShardIDSets Existing shards should continue to use inmem index. Disable compactions, writes and queries until all shards are loaded Gather results of opening shards concurrently, keeping track of how many databases we are managing. Check if any databases are running multiple index types. Enable all shards Close closes the store and all associated shards. After calling Close accessing shards through the Store will result in ErrStoreClosed being returned. No other goroutines accessing the store, so no need for a Lock. Close all the shards in parallel. Close out the series files. Store may now be opened again. epochsForShards returns a copy of the epoch trackers only including what is necessary for the provided shards. Must be called under the lock. openSeriesFile either returns or creates a series file for the provided database. It must be called under a full lock. createIndexIfNotExists returns a shared index for a database, if the inmem index is being used.

ShardN returns the number of shards in the store. ShardDigest returns a digest of the shard with the specified ID. CreateShard creates a shard with the given id and retention policy on a database. Shard already exists. Shard may be undergoing a pending deletion. While the shard can be recreated, it must wait for the pending delete to finish. Create the db and retention policy directories if they don't exist. Create the WAL directory. Retrieve database series file. Retrieve shared index, if needed. Copy index options and pass in shared index. CreateShardSnapShot will create a hard link to the underlying shard and return a path. The caller is responsible for cleaning up (removing) the file path returned. SetShardEnabled enables or disables a shard for read and writes. DeleteShards removes all shards from disk. DeleteShard removes a shard from disk. Remove the shard from Store so it's not returned to callers requesting shards. Also mark that this shard is currently being deleted in a separate map so that we do not have to retain the global store lock while deleting files. We are already being deleted? This is possible if delete shard was called twice in sequence before the shard could be removed from the mapping. This is not an error because deleting a shard twice is not an error. Determine if the shard contained any series that are not present in any other shards in the database. Ensure the pending deletion flag is cleared on exit. Get the shard's local bitset of series IDs. Remove any remaining series in the set from the series file, as they don't exist in any of the database's remaining shards. If the inmem index is in use, then the series being removed from the series file will also need to be removed from the index. Series key buffer. Buffer for tags container. Series File series key Close the shard. Remove the on-disk shard data. DeleteDatabase will close all shards associated with a database and remove the directory and files from disk. no files locally, so nothing to do Close series file. extra sanity check to make sure that even if someone named their database "../.." that we don't delete everything because of it, they'll just have extra files forever Remove database from store list of databases Remove shared index for database if using inmem index. DeleteRetentionPolicy will close all shards associated with the provided retention policy, remove the retention policy directories on both the DB and WAL, and remove all shard files from disk. unknown database, nothing to do Close and delete all shards under the retention policy on the Remove the retention policy folder. ensure Store's path is the grandparent of the retention policy Remove the retention policy folder from the the WAL. DeleteMeasurement removes a measurement and all associated series from a database. Limit to 1 delete for each shard since expanding the measurement into the list of series keys can be very memory intensive if run concurrently. install our guard and wait for any prior deletes to finish. the guard ensures future deletes that could conflict wait for us. filterShards returns a slice of shards where fn returns true for the shard. If the provided predicate is nil then all shards are returned. filterShards should be called under a lock. byDatabase provides a predicate for filterShards that matches on the name of the database passed in. walkShards apply a function to each shard in parallel. fn must be safe for concurrent use. If any of the functions return an error, the first error is ShardIDs returns a slice of all ShardIDs under management. shardsSlice returns an ordered list of shards. Databases returns the names of all databases managed by the store. DiskSize returns the size of all the shard files in bytes. This size does not include the WAL size. sketchesForDatabase returns merged sketches for the provided database, by walking each shard in the database and merging the sketches found there. Sketch estimating number of items. Sketch estimating number of tombstoned items. Never return nil sketches. In the case that db exists but no data written return empty sketches. Iterate over all shards for the database and combine all of the sketches. SeriesCardinality returns the exact series cardinality for the provided Cardinality is calculated exactly by unioning all shards' bitsets of series IDs. The result of this method cannot be combined with any other results. SeriesSketches returns the sketches associated with the series data in all the shards in the provided database. The returned sketches can be combined with other sketches to provide an estimation across distributed databases. MeasurementsCardinality returns an estimation of the measurement cardinality for the provided database. Cardinality is calculated using a sketch-based estimation. The result of this method cannot be combined with any other results. MeasurementsSketches returns the sketches associated with the measurement data in all the shards in the provided database. BackupShard will get the shard and have the engine backup since the passed in time to the writer. RestoreShard restores a backup from r to a given shard. This will only overwrite files included in the backup. ImportShard imports the contents of r to a given shard. All files in the backup are added as new files which may cause duplicated data to occur requiring more expensive compactions. ShardRelativePath will return the relative path to the shard, i.e., <database>/<retention>/<id>. DeleteSeries loops through the local shards and deletes the series data for the passed in series keys. Expand regex expressions in the FROM clause. Determine deletion time range. No series file means nothing has been written to this DB and thus nothing to delete. Determine list of measurements from sources. Use all measurements if no FROM clause was provided. Find matching series keys for each measurement. ExpandSources expands sources against all local shards. WriteToShard writes a list of points to a shard identified by its ID. enter the epoch tracker wait for any guards before writing the points. Ensure snapshot compactions are enabled since the shard might have been cold and disabled by the monitor. MeasurementNames returns a slice of all measurements. Measurements accepts an optional condition expression. If cond is nil, then all measurements for the database will be returned. Build indexset. MeasurementSeriesCounts returns the number of measurements and series in all the shards' indices. TODO: implement me TagKeys returns the tag keys in the given database, matching the condition. Get all the shards we're interested in. Determine list of measurements. Iterate over each measurement. Build keyset over all indexes for measurement. If no tag value filter is present then all the tag keys can be returned If they have authorized series associated with them. Add to resultset. Tag filter provided so filter keys first. Sort the tag keys. Filter against tag values, skip if no values exist. Filter final tag keys using the matching values. If a key has one or more matching values then it will be included in the final set. Use same backing array as keys to save allocation. Tag key k has one or more matching tag values. tagValues is a temporary representation of a TagValues. Rather than allocating KeyValues as we build up a TagValues object, We hold off allocating KeyValues until we have merged multiple tagValues together. Is a slice of tagValues that can be sorted by measurement. TagValues returns the tag keys and values for the provided shards, where the tag values satisfy the provided condition. Stores each list of TagValues for each measurement. Hint as to lower bound on number of measurements. names will be sorted by MeasurementNamesByExpr. Authorisation can be done later on, when series may have been filtered out by other conditions. Assuming all series in all shards. Iterate over each matching measurement in the shard. For each measurement we'll get the matching tag keys (e.g., when a WITH KEYS) statement is used, and we'll then use those to fetch all the relevant values from matching series. Series may be filtered using a WHERE Determine a list of keys from condition. No matching tag keys for this measurement Add the keys to the tagValues and sort them. get all the tag values for each key in the keyset. Each slice in the results contains the sorted values associated associated with each tag key for the measurement from the key set. remove any tag keys that didn't have any authorized values only include result if there are keys with values We need to sort all results by measurement name. The next stage is to merge the tagValue results for each shard's measurements. Used as a temporary buffer in mergeTagValues. There can be at most len(shards) instances of tagValues for a given measurement. Gather all occurrences of the same measurement for merging. An invariant is that there can't be more than n instances of tag key value pairs for a given measurement, where n is the number of shards. mergeTagValues merges multiple sorted sets of temporary tagValues using a direct k-way merge whilst also removing duplicated entries. The result is a single TagValue type. TODO(edd): a Tournament based merge (see: Knuth's TAOCP 5.4.1) might be more appropriate at some point. TODO(edd): will be too small likely. Find a hint? Resize and reset to the number of TagValues we're merging. Which of the provided TagValue sets currently holds the smallest element. j is the candidate we're going to next pick for the result set. Find the smallest element We have completely drained all tag keys and values for this shard. There are no tag values for these keys. We haven't picked a best TagValues set yet. Pick this one. It this tag key is lower than the candidate's tag key Same tag key but this tag value is lower than the candidate. Duplicate tag key/value pair.... Remove and move onto the next value for shard i. Drained all these tag values, move onto next key. We could have drained all of the TagValue sets and be done... Append the smallest KeyValue Increment the indexes for the chosen TagValue. No inmem shards... Only process 1 shard from each database inmem shards share the same index instance so just use the first one to avoid allocating the same measurements repeatedly Log at 80, 85, 90-100% levels KeyValue holds a string key and a string value. KeyValues is a sortable slice of KeyValue. Less implements sort.Interface. Keys are compared before values. decodeStorePath extracts the database and retention policy names from a given shard or WAL path. shardOrWALPath format: /maybe/absolute/base/then/:database/:retentionPolicy/:nameOfShardOrWAL Discard the last part of the path (the shard name or the wal name).

ErrTimeout is returned when a write times out. ErrPartialWrite is returned when a write partially succeeds but does not meet the requested consistency level. ErrWriteFailed is returned when no writes succeeded. PointsWriter handles writes across multiple local and remote data nodes. WritePointsRequest represents a request to write point data to the cluster. AddPoint adds a point to the WritePointRequest with field key 'value' NewPointsWriter returns a new instance of PointsWriter for a node. ShardMapping contains a mapping of shards to points. The points associated with a shard ID The shards that have been mapped, keyed by shard ID Points that were dropped NewShardMapping creates an empty ShardMapping. MapPoint adds the point to the ShardMapping, associated with the given shardInfo. Open opens the communication channel with the point writer. Close closes the communication channel with the point writer. 'nil' channels always block so this makes the select statement in WritePoints hit its default case dropping any in-flight writes. WithLogger sets the Logger on w. WriteStatistics keeps statistics related to the PointsWriter. MapShards maps the points contained in wp to a ShardMapping.  If a point maps to a shard group or shard that does not currently exist, it will be created before returning the mapping. Holds all the shard groups and shards that are required for writes. Either the point is outside the scope of the RP, or we already have a suitable shard group for the point. No shard groups overlap with the point's time, so we will create a new shard group for this point. We didn't create a shard group because the point was outside the scope of the RP. sgList is a wrapper around a meta.ShardGroupInfos where we can also check if a given time is covered by any of the shard groups in the list. ShardGroupAt attempts to find a shard group that could contain a point at the given time. Shard groups are sorted first according to end time, and then according to start time. Therefore, if there are multiple shard groups that match this point's time they will be preferred in this order:  - a shard group with the earliest end time;  - (assuming identical end times) the shard group with the earliest start time. We couldn't find a shard group the point falls into. Append appends a shard group to the list, and returns a sorted list.

Name of the retention policy used by the monitor service. Duration of the monitor retention policy. Default replication factor to set on the monitor retention policy. Monitor represents an instance of the monitor system. Build information for diagnostics. Writer for pushing stats back into the database. PointsWriter is a simplified interface for writing the points the monitor gathers. New returns a new instance of the monitor system. open returns whether the monitor service is open. Open opens the monitoring system, using the given clusterID, node ID, and hostname for identification purpose. Self-register various stats and diagnostics. If enabled, record stats in a InfluxDB system. Start periodic writes to system. Enabled returns true if any underlying Config is Enabled. WritePoints writes the points the monitor gathers. Close closes the monitor system. SetGlobalTag can be used to set tags that will appear on all points written by the Monitor. RemoteWriterConfig represents the configuration of a remote writer. SetPointsWriter can be used to set a writer for the monitoring points. not enabled, nothing to do Subsequent calls to an already open Monitor are just a no-op. WithLogger sets the logger for the Monitor. RegisterDiagnosticsClient registers a diagnostics client with the given name and tags. DeregisterDiagnosticsClient deregisters a diagnostics client by name. Statistics returns the combined statistics for all expvar data. The given tags are added to each of the returned statistics. Skip built-in expvar stats. Add any supplied tags. Every other top-level expvar value should be a map. straight to string name. string-string tags map. string-interface map. If a registered client has no field data, don't include it in the results Add Go memstats. Add any supplied tags to Go memstats Diagnostics fetches diagnostic information for each registered diagnostic client. It skips any clients that return an error when retrieving their diagnostics. createInternalStorage ensures the internal storage has been created. Mark storage creation complete. waitUntilInterval waits until we are on an even interval for the duration. storeStatistics writes the statistics to an InfluxDB system. Wait until an even interval to start recording monitor statistics. If we are interrupted before the interval for some reason, exit early. Write all stats in batches Write the last batch Statistic represents the information returned by a single monitor client. ValueNames returns a sorted list of the value names, if any.

ShardGroupDeletedExpiration is the amount of time before a shard group info will be removed from cached data after it has been marked deleted (2 weeks). Name of the bucket to store TSM metadata ErrServiceUnavailable is returned when the meta service is unavailable. ErrService is returned when the meta service returns an error. Client is used to execute commands on and read data from a meta service cluster. Authentication cache. NewClient returns a new *Client. Open a connection to a meta service cluster. Try to load from disk If this is a brand new instance, persist to disk immediately. Close the meta service cluster connection. AcquireLease attempts to acquire the specified lease. TODO corylanou remove this for single node ClusterID returns the ID of the cluster it's connected to. Database returns info for the requested database. Databases returns a list of all database infos. CreateDatabase creates a database or returns it if it already exists. create default retention policy CreateDatabaseWithRetentionPolicy creates a database with the specified retention policy. When creating a database with a retention policy, the retention policy will always be set to default. Therefore if the caller provides a retention policy that already exists on the database, but that retention policy is not the default one, an error will be returned. This call is only idempotent when the caller provides the exact same retention policy, and that retention policy is already the default for the No existing retention policies, so we can create the provided policy as the new default policy. In this case we already have a retention policy on the database and the provided retention policy does not match it. Therefore, this call is not idempotent and we need to return an error. If a non-default retention policy was passed in that already exists then it's an error regardless of if the exact same retention policy is provided. CREATE DATABASE WITH RETENTION POLICY should only be used to create DEFAULT retention policies. Commit the changes. Refresh the database info. DropDatabase deletes a database. CreateRetentionPolicy creates a retention policy on the specified database. RetentionPolicy returns the requested retention policy info. DropRetentionPolicy drops a retention policy from a database. UpdateRetentionPolicy updates a retention policy. Users returns a slice of UserInfo representing the currently known users. User returns the user with the given name, or ErrUserNotFound. bcryptCost is the cost associated with generating password with bcrypt. This setting is lowered during testing to improve test suite performance. CreateUser adds a user with the given name and password and admin status. See if the user already exists. Hash the password before serializing it. UpdateUser updates the password of an existing user. DropUser removes the user with the given name. SetPrivilege sets a privilege for the given user on the given database. SetAdminPrivilege sets or unsets admin privilege to the given username. UserPrivileges returns the privileges for a user mapped by database name. UserPrivilege returns the privilege for the given user on the given database. AdminUserExists returns true if any user has admin privilege. Authenticate returns a UserInfo if the username and password match an existing entry. Find user. Check the local auth cache first. Compare password with user hash. generate a salt and hash of the password for the cache UserCount returns the number of users stored. ShardIDs returns a list of all shard ids. ShardGroupsByTimeRange returns a list of all shard groups on a database and policy that may contain data for the specified time range. Shard groups are sorted by start time. Find retention policy. ShardsByTimeRange returns a slice of shards that may contain data in the time range. DropShard deletes a shard by ID. TruncateShardGroups truncates any shard group that could contain timestamps beyond t. PruneShardGroups remove deleted shard groups from the data store. CreateShardGroupWithShards creates a shard group on a database and policy for a given timestamp and assign shards to the shard group Check under a read-lock Check again under the write lock It is the responsibility of the caller to check if it exists before calling this method. DeleteShardGroup removes a shard group from a database and retention policy by id. PrecreateShardGroups creates shard groups whose endtime is before the 'to' time passed in, but is yet to expire before 'from'. This is to avoid the need for these shards to be created when data for the corresponding time range arrives. Shard creation involves Raft consensus, and precreation avoids taking the hit at write-time. No data was ever written to this group, or all groups have been deleted. Get the last group in time. Group is not deleted, will end before the future time, but is still yet to expire. This last check is important, so the system doesn't create shards groups wholly in the past. Create successive shard group. if it already exists, continue ShardOwner returns the owning shard group info for a specific shard. CreateContinuousQuery saves a continuous query with the given name for the given database. DropContinuousQuery removes the continuous query with the given name on the given database. CreateSubscription creates a subscription against the given database and retention policy. DropSubscription removes the named subscription from the given database and retention policy. SetData overwrites the underlying data in the meta store. Data returns a clone of the underlying data in the meta store. WaitForDataChanged returns a channel that will get closed when the metastore data has changed. commit writes data to the underlying store. This method assumes c's mutex is already locked. try to write to disk before updating in memory update in memory close channels to signal changes MarshalBinary returns a binary representation of the underlying data. WithLogger sets the logger for the client. snapshot saves the current meta data to disk. Load loads the current meta data from disk.leases/Users/austinjaybecker/projects/abeck-go-testing/v1/services/meta/config.gotoml:"retention-autocreate"`toml:"retention-autocreate"`toml:"logging-enabled"`toml:"logging-enabled"`Meta.Dir must be specified"Meta.Dir must be specified" DefaultLeaseDuration is the default duration for leases. DefaultLoggingEnabled determines if log messages are printed for the meta service. Config represents the meta configuration. NewConfig builds a new configuration with default values. Validate returns an error if the config is invalid./Users/austinjaybecker/projects/abeck-go-testing/v1/services/meta/context.go NewContextWithUser returns a new context with user added.

DefaultRetentionPolicyDuration is the default value of RetentionPolicyInfo.Duration. DefaultRetentionPolicyName is the default name for auto generated retention policies. MinRetentionPolicyDuration represents the minimum duration for a policy. MaxNameLen is the maximum length of a database or retention policy name. InfluxDB uses the name for the directory name on disk. Data represents the top level collection of all metadata. associated raft term associated raft index adminUserExists provides a constant time mechanism for determining if there is at least one admin user. Database returns a DatabaseInfo by the database name. CloneDatabases returns a copy of the DatabaseInfo. CreateDatabase creates a new database. It returns an error if name is blank or if a database with the same name already exists. Append new node. DropDatabase removes a database by name. It does not return an error if the database cannot be found. Remove all user privileges associated with this database. RetentionPolicy returns a retention policy for a database by name. CreateRetentionPolicy creates a new retention policy on a database. It returns an error if name is blank or if the database does not exist. Validate retention policy. Normalise ShardDuration before comparing to any existing retention policies. The client is supposed to do this, but do it again to verify input. Find database. RP with that name already exists. Make sure they're the same. if they want to make it default, and it's not the default, it's not an identical command so it's an error Append copy of new policy. Set the default if needed DropRetentionPolicy removes a retention policy from a database by name. no database? no problem Remove from list. RetentionPolicyUpdate represents retention policy fields to be updated. SetName sets the RetentionPolicyUpdate.Name. SetDuration sets the RetentionPolicyUpdate.Duration. SetReplicaN sets the RetentionPolicyUpdate.ReplicaN. SetShardGroupDuration sets the RetentionPolicyUpdate.ShardGroupDuration. UpdateRetentionPolicy updates an existing retention policy. Find policy. Ensure new policy doesn't match an existing policy. Enforce duration of at least MinRetentionPolicyDuration Enforce duration is at least the shard duration Update fields. DropShard removes a shard by ID. DropShard won't return an error if the shard can't be found, which allows the command to be re-run in the case that the meta store succeeds but a data node fails. We just deleted the last shard in the shard group. ShardGroups returns a list of all shard groups on a database and retention policy. ShardGroupByTimestamp returns the shard group on a database and policy for a given timestamp. CreateShardGroup creates a shard group on a database and policy for a given timestamp. Verify that shard group doesn't already exist for this timestamp. Create the shard group. Shard group range is [start, end) so add one to the max time. Retention policy has a new shard group, so update the policy. Shard Groups must be stored in sorted order, as other parts of the system assume this to be the case. Find shard group by ID and set its deletion timestamp. CreateContinuousQuery adds a named continuous query to a database. Ensure the name doesn't already exist. If the query string is the same, we'll silently return, otherwise we'll assume the user might be trying to overwrite an existing CQ with a different query.lint:ignore SA6005 this is old code so we should revisit the use of strings.EqualFold Append new query. DropContinuousQuery removes a continuous query. validateURL returns an error if the URL does not have a port or uses a scheme other than UDP or HTTP. CreateSubscription adds a named subscription to a database and retention policy. DropSubscription removes a subscription. User returns a user by username. prevent non-nil interface with nil pointer CreateUser creates a new user. Ensure the user doesn't already exist. Append new user. We know there is now at least one admin user. DropUser removes an existing user by name. Maybe we dropped the only admin user? UpdateUser updates the password hash of an existing user. CloneUsers returns a copy of the user infos. SetPrivilege sets a privilege for a user on a database. SetAdminPrivilege sets the admin privilege for a user. We could have promoted or revoked the only admin. Check if an admin user exists. AdminUserExists returns true if an admin user exists. UserPrivileges gets the privileges for a user. UserPrivilege gets the privilege for a user on a database. Clone returns a copy of data with a new version. marshal serializes data to a protobuf representation. Need this for reverse compatibility unmarshal deserializes from a protobuf representation. Exhaustively determine if there is an admin user. The marshalled cache value may not be correct. MarshalBinary encodes the metadata to a binary format. UnmarshalBinary decodes the object from a binary format. future shardgroup hasAdminUser exhaustively checks for the presence of at least one admin user. ImportData imports selected data into the current metadata. if non-empty, backupDBName, restoreDBName, backupRPName, restoreRPName can be used to select DB metadata from other, and to assign a new name to the imported data.  Returns a map of shard ID's in the old metadata to new shard ID's in the new metadata, along with a list of new databases created, both of which can assist in the import of existing shard data during a database restore. if no backupDBName then we'll try to import all the DB's.  If one of them fails, we'll mark the whole operation a failure and return an error. importOneDB imports a single database/rp from an external metadata object, renaming them if new names are provided. change the names if we want/need to import all RP's without renaming renumber the shard groups and shards for the new retention policy(ies) OSS doesn't use Owners but if we are importing this from Enterprise, we'll want to clear it out to avoid any issues if they ever export this DB again to bring back to Enterprise. NodeInfo represents information about a single node in the cluster. NodeInfos is a slice of NodeInfo used for sorting DatabaseInfo represents information about a database in the system. RetentionPolicy returns a retention policy by name. ShardInfos returns a list of all shards' info for the database. Skip deleted shard groups clone returns a deep copy of di. Copy continuous queries. MarshalBinary encodes dbi to a binary format. UnmarshalBinary decodes dbi from a binary format. marshal serializes to a protobuf representation. RetentionPolicySpec represents the specification for a new retention policy. NewRetentionPolicyInfo creates a new retention policy info from the specification. Matches checks if this retention policy specification matches an existing retention policy. Normalise ShardDuration before comparing to any existing retention policies. Normalize with the retention policy info's duration instead of the spec since they should be the same and we're performing a comparison. MarshalBinary encodes RetentionPolicySpec to a binary format. UnmarshalBinary decodes RetentionPolicySpec from a binary format. RetentionPolicyInfo represents metadata about a retention policy. NewRetentionPolicyInfo returns a new instance of RetentionPolicyInfo with default replication and duration. DefaultRetentionPolicyInfo returns a new instance of RetentionPolicyInfo with default name, replication, and duration. ToSpec returns RetentionPolicySpec instance with the same data as in RetentionPolicyInfo Apply applies a specification to the retention policy info. ShardGroupByTimestamp returns the shard group in the policy that contains the timestamp, or nil if no shard group matches. ExpiredShardGroups returns the Shard Groups which are considered expired, for the given time. DeletedShardGroups returns the Shard Groups which are marked as deleted. clone returns a deep copy of rpi. MarshalBinary encodes rpi to a binary format. UnmarshalBinary decodes rpi from a binary format. shardGroupDuration returns the default duration for a shard group based on a policy duration. 6 months or 0 2 days normalisedShardDuration returns normalised shard duration based on a policy duration. If it is zero, it likely wasn't specified, so we default to the shard group duration If it was specified, but it's less than the MinRetentionPolicyDuration, then normalize to the MinRetentionPolicyDuration ShardGroupInfo represents metadata about a shard group. The DeletedAt field is important because it makes it clear that a ShardGroup has been marked as deleted, and allow the system to be sure that a ShardGroup is not simply missing. If the DeletedAt is set, the system can safely delete any associated shards. ShardGroupInfos implements sort.Interface on []ShardGroupInfo, based on the StartTime field. Contains returns true iif StartTime ≤ t < EndTime. Overlaps returns whether the shard group contains data for the time range between min and max Deleted returns whether this ShardGroup has been deleted. Truncated returns true if this ShardGroup has been truncated (no new writes). clone returns a deep copy of sgi. ShardFor returns the ShardInfo for a Point hash. ShardInfo represents metadata about a shard. OwnedBy determines whether the shard's owner IDs includes nodeID. clone returns a deep copy of si. If deprecated "OwnerIDs" exists then convert it to "Owners" format. SubscriptionInfo holds the subscription information. ShardOwner represents a node that owns a shard. clone returns a deep copy of so. ContinuousQueryInfo represents metadata about a continuous query. clone returns a deep copy of cqi. UserInfo represents metadata about a user in the system. User's name. Hashed password. Whether the user is an admin, i.e. allowed to do everything. Map of database name to granted privilege. AuthorizeDatabase returns true if the user is authorized for the given privilege on the given database. AuthorizeSeriesRead is used to limit access per-series (enterprise only) AuthorizeSeriesWrite is used to limit access per-series (enterprise only) AuthorizeUnrestricted allows admins to shortcut access checks. Lease represents a lease held on a resource. Leases is a concurrency-safe collection of leases keyed by name. NewLeases returns a new instance of Leases. Acquire acquires a lease with the given name for the given nodeID. If the lease doesn't exist or exists but is expired, a valid lease is returned. If nodeID already owns the named and unexpired lease, the lease expiration is extended. If a different node owns the lease, an error is returned. MarshalTime converts t to nanoseconds since epoch. A zero time returns 0. UnmarshalTime converts nanoseconds since epoch to time. A zero value returns a zero time.

TODO(jeff): this was a typed nil TODO(jsternberg): Use a real authorizer. Getting values of _measurement or _field are handled specially If there are any references to _field, we need to use the slow path since we cannot rely on the index alone. If there is a predicate on _field, we cannot use the index to filter out unwanted measurement names. Use a slower block scan instead. If there predicates on anything besides _measurement, we can't use the index and need to use the slow path. tagValuesSlow will determine the tag values for the given tagKey. It's generally faster to use tagValues, measurementFields or MeasurementNames, but those methods will only use the index and metadata stored in the shard. Because fields are not themselves indexed, we have no way of correlating fields to tag values, so we sometimes need to consult tsm to provide an accurate answer. no data for series key + field combination?

WriteTo reads r in batches and writes to a target specified by filter. we loop twice to check if both read and write have an error. if read exits cleanly, then we still want to wait for write. only if there is any error, exit immediately. read will close the line channel when there is no more data, or an error occurs. it is possible for an io.Reader to block forever; Write's context can be used to cancel, but, it's possible there will be dangling read go routines. exit early if the context is done finishes when the lines channel is closed or context is done. if an error occurs while writing data to the write service, the error is send in the errC channel and the function returns. if read closes the channel normally, exit the loop write if we exceed the max lines OR read routine has finished ScanLines is used in bufio.Scanner.Split to split lines of line protocol. We have a full newline-terminated line. If we're at EOF, we have a final, non-terminated line. Return it.
